# PickleJourney™ Implementation Status

**PKL-278651-JOUR-002 Sprint Status Report**  
**Last Updated:** April 30, 2025  
**Status:** Work in Progress

## 1. Project Overview

PickleJourney™ is evolving into a comprehensive personal growth center for Pickle+ users, supporting multiple roles in the pickleball ecosystem (player, coach, referee) with emotionally intelligent features. The current sprint has focused on three main phases:

1. Multi-Role Foundation (PKL-278651-JOUR-002.1)
2. Adaptive Journey Dashboard (PKL-278651-JOUR-002.2)
3. Integration & Enhancement (PKL-278651-JOUR-002.3)

## 2. Completed Features

### 2.1 Multi-Role Foundation
- ✅ Created `JourneyRoleContext` for centralized role state management
- ✅ Built `RoleSwitcher` component with Framer Motion animations for role switching
- ✅ Implemented `useJourneyRoles` hook for accessing role functions throughout the app
- ✅ Added role discovery and onboarding wizard

### 2.2 Adaptive Journey Dashboard
- ✅ Role-specific `JourneyDashboard` that adapts to current selected role
- ✅ Created components for `JourneySummary`, `DailyPrompt`, `JourneyMap`, and `RecentActivity`
- ✅ Added responsive design for multiple screen sizes
- ✅ Implemented activity tracking visualization

### 2.3 Emotional Intelligence Integration (Partial)
- ✅ Created `EmotionContext` provider for centralized emotion state management
- ✅ Implemented `useEmotionDetection` hook with text analysis capabilities
- ✅ Built `EmotionReporter` component for self-reporting emotional states
- ✅ Developed `EmotionallyAdaptivePrompt` component that changes based on emotional state
- ✅ Fixed export/import issues in emotional intelligence components

## 3. Current Architecture

### 3.1 Key Components & Files

#### Contexts
- `client/src/modules/picklejourney/contexts/JourneyRoleContext.tsx` - Manages role state
- `client/src/modules/picklejourney/contexts/EmotionContext.tsx` - Manages emotional intelligence

#### Components
- `client/src/modules/picklejourney/components/dashboard/JourneyDashboard.tsx` - Main dashboard
- `client/src/modules/picklejourney/components/dashboard/RoleSwitcher.tsx` - UI for switching roles
- `client/src/modules/picklejourney/components/EmotionallyAdaptivePrompt.tsx` - Prompts that adapt to emotion
- `client/src/modules/picklejourney/components/EmotionReporter.tsx` - Self-reporting emotional UI

#### Hooks
- `client/src/modules/picklejourney/hooks/useJourneyRoles.ts` - Role management hook
- `client/src/modules/picklejourney/hooks/useEmotionDetection.ts` - Emotion detection logic

#### Types
- `client/src/modules/picklejourney/types.ts` - Type definitions for the module

#### Page
- `client/src/pages/PickleJourneyDashboard.tsx` - Main page with context providers

### 3.2 Data Flow
1. User accesses `/journey` route
2. `PickleJourneyDashboard` wraps components with necessary providers
3. `JourneyRoleContext` manages role selection state
4. `EmotionContext` tracks and manages emotional state
5. Components adapt based on current role and emotional state

## 4. Current Limitations & Known Issues

1. **Emotion Detection Accuracy**
   - Text analysis is currently basic, pattern-matching only
   - No persistent storage of emotional data yet

2. **Role-Based Content**
   - Content for referee role is less developed than player and coach
   - Some role-specific features planned but not yet implemented

3. **API Integration**
   - Limited backend integration for emotional intelligence features
   - No API for storing/retrieving historical emotional data

4. **Interface**
   - Some emotionally adaptive UI elements need refinement

## 5. Next Steps (Future Sprints)

### 5.1 PKL-278651-JOUR-003.1: Enhanced Emotional Intelligence
- Integrate with NLP API for better emotion detection
- Add emotional trend analysis over time
- Create more adaptive UI elements responding to emotional state
- Store historical emotional data

### 5.2 PKL-278651-JOUR-003.2: Multi-Role Progress Tracking
- Implement specialized metrics for each role
- Create role-specific achievement systems
- Build analytics dashboard for cross-role progress
- Implement role synergy indicators

### 5.3 PKL-278651-JOUR-003.3: Community Integration
- Connect PickleJourney™ with community features
- Add role-based community suggestions
- Create mentor-mentee connections based on roles
- Share achievements with community

### 5.4 PKL-278651-JOUR-003.4: Coaching Features Integration
- Integrate with coaching ecosystem (when feature flag is removed)
- Create coach-specific tools 
- Implement student progress tracking
- Build feedback loops between coaching and journey progress

## 6. Development Notes

### 6.1 Emotion Detection System
The emotion detection system classifies emotional states into five categories:
- `frustrated-disappointed`
- `anxious-uncertain`
- `neutral-focused`
- `excited-proud`
- `determined-growth`

Detection occurs through:
1. Text analysis (keyword detection)
2. Self-reporting via UI
3. Interaction pattern analysis (future)

### 6.2 Role Management
Current supported roles:
- `PLAYER` - For those playing pickleball
- `COACH` - For those teaching pickleball
- `REFEREE` - For those officiating matches
- `ADMIN` - For system administrators

### 6.3 Technical Debt & Optimizations
- Consider refactoring emotion detection to move text analysis to the server
- Optimize role switching animations for performance
- Create unit tests for emotion detection and role management
- Update types to be more specific where generic types are currently used

## 7. Assets & Resources
- UI assets are in `attached_assets/` directory
- Emotion icons were custom designed for the platform
- Role icons use standard Lucide React icons with custom styling
