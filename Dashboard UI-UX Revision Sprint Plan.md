# Pickle+ Dashboard Redesign: SAGE & PickleJourney™ Integration Sprint Plan

## Sprint Overview

**Sprint Name:** Dashboard Evolution - Phase 1: PickleJourney™ Integration
**Duration:** 4 Weeks
**Goal:** Transform the dashboard into a personal growth center focused on journaling and SAGE integration, while migrating statistical components to the profile page

## Strategic Rationale

This redesign positions the dashboard as the user's daily touchpoint for reflection, growth, and guidance, rather than a statistics overview. The dashboard becomes forward-looking (what to improve) while the profile becomes retrospective (what has been accomplished).

## User Experience Vision

The new dashboard will serve as a daily "home base" where users begin and end their pickleball journey each day. It will prioritize:

1. **Personal Growth** - Journal entries, goal tracking, and progress visualization
2. **AI Guidance** - Enhanced SAGE integration for personalized recommendations
3. **Daily Engagement** - Prompts, streaks, and micro-interactions that encourage regular use
4. **Simplified Focus** - Clearer user flows with less cognitive load

## Design Philosophy

- **Minimalist Expansion** - Start with essential journaling features, expand thoughtfully
- **Contextual Intelligence** - Surface relevant information based on user's journey stage
- **Emotional Design** - Create moments of delight that celebrate progress
- **Progressive Disclosure** - Reveal advanced features as users engage more deeply

## Technical Considerations

### Database Structure
- Implement schema designed in the PickleJourney™ specification
- Optimize for frequent writes (multiple journal entries per day)
- Design for efficient querying of journal entry patterns
- Plan for media storage scalability (videos, images)

### Performance Targets
- Journal entry saving: < 500ms
- Dashboard initial load: < 1.5 seconds
- Journal timeline rendering: < 750ms
- SAGE insight generation: < 3 seconds

### Security Considerations
- Private journal entries must be encrypted at rest
- Granular permission system for shared entries
- Audit trail for all journal access events
- Privacy controls for SAGE analysis opt-in/out

## Success Metrics

### Engagement Metrics
