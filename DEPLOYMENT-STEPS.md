# Pickle+ Deployment Steps - Simplified Approach

Follow these steps to deploy the Pickle+ application using Replit's standard deployment method:

## 1. No Special Scripts Needed

We've made specific, targeted fixes to the core codebase:
- Added robust error handling in `passport.deserializeUser`
- Fixed port configuration to use port 5000 for Replit deployment
- Ensured the session handling is resilient

## 2. Configure Deployment in Replit

In the Replit deployment settings:
1. Click the Deploy button
2. Choose Cloud Run deployment
3. Use the default settings:
   - **Build Command**: Leave as default (`npm run build`)
   - **Run Command**: Leave as default (`npm start`)
   - Ensure `DATABASE_URL` is set in environment variables

## 3. Key Fixes for Deployment Success

Our targeted changes ensure:
- Authentication works reliably in production
- The server uses the correct port (5000) for Replit deployment
- Error handling gracefully handles auth failures without crashing
- Sessions persist correctly

## 4. Deploy and Monitor

After deployment:
- Check the logs for any authentication errors
- Test authentication by logging in/out
- Verify all API endpoints are working
- Ensure the actual Pickle+ application loads (not placeholder)

The simplified approach avoids complex deployment scripts while still addressing the core issues.
