# Professional Tier Enhanced Weighting System - FINAL IMPLEMENTATION STATUS

## ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE** - August 6, 2025

The Professional Tier Enhanced Weighting system has been **fully implemented** across the Pickle+ platform with sophisticated tier-specific decay protection that heavily incentivizes competitive play for professional players while maintaining accessibility.

---

## üéØ **FINALIZED ALGORITHM SPECIFICATIONS**

### **4-Tier Player Classification System**
- **Recreational (0-300 pts):** 1% weekly decay, No holiday decay
- **Competitive (300-1000 pts):** 2% weekly decay, No holiday decay  
- **Elite (1000-1800 pts):** 5% weekly decay, 2.5% holiday decay
- **Professional (1800+ pts):** 7% weekly decay, 3.5% holiday decay

### **Tier-Specific Match Weighting**

#### **Standard Tiers (Recreational/Competitive/Elite)**
- **Tournament matches:** 2x weight for decay protection
- **League matches:** 1.5x weight for decay protection
- **Casual matches:** 1x weight for decay protection

#### **Professional Tier Enhanced Weighting** ‚≠ê **NEW**
- **Tournament matches:** **3x weight** (50% higher than standard)
- **League matches:** **2x weight** (33% higher than standard)
- **Casual matches:** **0.75x weight** (25% reduced value)

### **Activity Protection Thresholds**
- **High Activity (4+ weighted matches/month):** No decay
- **Moderate Activity (2-3 weighted matches/month):** 1% weekly decay
- **Low Activity (1 weighted match/month):** 1.5% weekly decay
- **Inactive (0 matches/month):** Full tier-based decay rate

## üìä **PROFESSIONAL TIER ACTIVITY EXAMPLES**

### **Tournament-Focused Pro Player**
- **2 tournaments/month** = 6 weighted matches ‚Üí **No decay**
- **1 tournament + 2 casual** = 4.5 weighted matches ‚Üí **No decay**

### **League-Heavy Pro Player**  
- **3 league matches/month** = 6 weighted matches ‚Üí **No decay**
- **2 league + 1 casual** = 4.75 weighted matches ‚Üí **No decay**

### **Casual-Only Pro Player**
- **6 casual matches/month** = 4.5 weighted matches ‚Üí **No decay**
- **8 casual matches/month** = 6 weighted matches ‚Üí **No decay**

### **Moderate Activity Pro Player**
- **1 tournament + 1 casual** = 3.75 weighted matches ‚Üí **1% decay** (vs 7% base)
