# Pickle+ Tournament Management System - Reorganized Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the revised implementation strategy for the Pickle+ Tournament Management System, focusing on a "backend-first" approach that prioritizes admin functionality and CRUD operations before moving to user-facing features. This system will allow for comprehensive tournament management with support for multi-event tournaments, team tournaments, and advanced ranking calculations.

## Core Features
1. Tournament creation and management
2. Qualification based on ranking points
3. Multiple tournament formats (single/double elimination, round robin)
4. Team tournaments with roster management
5. Tournament-based ranking points earning
6. Qualifying rounds for high-demand events
7. **Multi-event tournaments with different divisions and categories**
