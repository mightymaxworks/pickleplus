# Sprint 2: Student Progress Tracking System
## Implementation Preview & Development Plan

### Overview
Sprint 2 builds upon Sprint 1's curriculum management foundation to create a comprehensive student progress tracking system. This sprint integrates with the operational drill library and PCP rating system to provide real-time performance analytics and achievement tracking.

## Sprint 2 Objectives

### Primary Goal
Create a complete student progress tracking ecosystem that allows coaches to:
- Monitor individual student performance across PCP 4-dimensional ratings
- Track drill completion rates and skill improvement trends
- Generate personalized development recommendations
- Manage student portfolios with historical performance data

### Success Metrics
- **Student Engagement**: 40% increase in drill completion rates
- **Coach Efficiency**: 60% reduction in manual progress tracking time
- **Performance Insights**: Real-time analytics for all 4 PCP dimensions
- **Retention**: 25% improvement in student session consistency
