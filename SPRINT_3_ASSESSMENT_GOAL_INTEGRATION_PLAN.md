   - Timeline view showing goal progress over time

### Phase 3: Unified Coach Workflow (Days 5-6)
**Objective**: Create seamless end-to-end workflow integration

#### Backend Tasks
1. **Workflow API Endpoints**
   ```typescript
   // Unified Workflow
   GET /api/coach/workflow/:studentId - Complete student development workflow
   GET /api/coach/dashboard/overview - Enhanced coach dashboard with assessment-goal metrics
   POST /api/coach/sessions/:id/assessment-and-goals - Complete post-session workflow
   ```

2. **Analytics Enhancement**
   - Coach effectiveness metrics based on student goal achievement
   - Assessment-to-improvement correlation tracking
   - Student engagement metrics with goal progress

#### Frontend Tasks
