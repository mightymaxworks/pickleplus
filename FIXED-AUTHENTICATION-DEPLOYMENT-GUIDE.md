# Pickle+ Fixed Authentication Deployment Guide

This guide addresses the authentication issue in your deployment where you received the error message `{"message":"Failed to deserialize user out of session"}`.

## Understanding the Problem

The error occurs because the original deployment script didn't properly handle authentication and session management in production. The key issues were:

1. Session store configuration was missing
2. User deserialization from the session was failing
3. PostgreSQL session store wasn't properly configured

## Solution

We've created a new deployment script (`auth-fixed-deploy.sh`) that properly handles authentication by:

1. Creating a custom production server with complete authentication setup
2. Properly configuring session management with Postgres session store
3. Ensuring user serialization/deserialization works correctly
4. Setting up all necessary routes for authentication (/api/auth/*)

## Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Verify Files

Make sure these files exist in your project:
- `auth-fixed-deploy.sh` (main deployment script)
- `es-auth-deployment-fix.js` (authentication fixes)
- `es-port-fix.js` (port configuration fixes)

### Step 2: Run Pre-Deployment Check

Make sure your database is properly configured with:
- PostgreSQL database is available and accessible
- DATABASE_URL is set in your environment variables

### Step 3: Deploy with Authentication Fix

1. In Replit UI, click the "Deploy" button on the right sidebar
2. Choose Cloud Run as the target
3. Set the following settings:
   - **Build Command**: `bash auth-fixed-deploy.sh`
   - **Run Command**: `cd dist && ./start.sh`
   - **Environment Variables**: Make sure `DATABASE_URL` is set
4. Click Deploy

## Verifying Deployment

After deployment, you should be able to:
1. Access the application without the "Failed to deserialize user out of session" error
2. Log in and stay logged in across page reloads
3. Access protected routes that require authentication

## Troubleshooting

If you're still experiencing authentication issues:

1. Check the Replit logs for any errors during startup
2. Verify the DATABASE_URL environment variable is set correctly
3. Ensure you're using the correct session cookie in your requests

For any persistent issues, try adding console logs in the user serialization/deserialization functions to debug the issue.

## Security Notes

1. The `SESSION_SECRET` is set in the deployment script. For production environments, consider setting this as an environment variable.
2. The session cookie is set to `secure: false` to work with Replit. In a true production environment, this should be `true` when using HTTPS.
