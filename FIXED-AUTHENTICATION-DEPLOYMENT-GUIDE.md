# Pickle+ Authentication-Fixed Full Deployment Guide

This guide provides instructions for deploying the full Pickle+ application with proper authentication handling.

## What This Deployment Fixes

This deployment script focuses on fixing the authentication issues that were causing internal server errors in previous deployments:

1. **Session Deserialization Issues**:
   - Adds robust error handling in `passport.deserializeUser`
   - Uses direct SQL queries instead of Drizzle ORM for critical user operations
   - Properly checks for null/undefined values throughout the authentication flow

2. **Database Connection Reliability**:
   - Implements connection pooling with timeouts
   - Adds retry logic for failed connections
   - Falls back to memory session store if database connection fails

3. **Client Build Handling**:
   - Checks for existing client builds in multiple locations
   - Falls back to serving static files from public directory if no build exists
   - Creates minimal client files if necessary

4. **Port Configuration**:
   - Explicitly binds to port 5000 (required by Replit Cloud Run)
   - Sets up the server to listen on all interfaces (0.0.0.0)

## Deployment Steps

1. **Prepare Your Environment**:
   - Ensure you have the Replit database provisioned
   - Verify that the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is set

2. **Run the Deployment**:
   - Click the Deploy button in Replit
   - Set the Build Command to: `bash auth-fixed-full-deploy.sh`
   - Set the Run Command to: `cd dist && ./start.sh`
   - Make sure `DATABASE_URL` is set in the environment variables
   - Click Deploy

3. **Verify Deployment**:
   - After deployment, check the health endpoint: `/api/health`
   - Verify that authentication works by logging in

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues after deployment:

### Authentication Issues
- Check the server logs for specific authentication errors
- Try clearing your browser cookies and reloading the page
- Verify that the database contains user records

### Database Connection Issues
- Check that the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is set correctly
- Verify database connectivity from Replit
- Check the server logs for connection errors

### Client Loading Issues
- If the client doesn't load properly, check the browser console for errors
- Verify that static assets are being served correctly

## Technical Details

### Authentication Flow
The authentication system uses Passport.js with the Local strategy. The authentication flow is:

1. User submits login credentials
2. Passport validates credentials against the database
3. On success, Passport serializes the user ID to the session
4. On subsequent requests, Passport deserializes the user from the database

The fixes in this deployment focus on making each step of this flow more robust, with proper error handling and fallbacks.

### Session Management
Sessions are stored in the PostgreSQL database using connect-pg-simple. If the database connection fails, the system falls back to memory-based sessions to prevent application crashes.

### Database Connection
The connection to the database is established using the @neondatabase/serverless client, which is designed to work well with serverless deployments like Replit Cloud Run.
