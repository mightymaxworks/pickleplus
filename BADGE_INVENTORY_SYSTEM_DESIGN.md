# Badge/Card Inventory System for Total Dominance Achievements

## Overview
When players achieve "Total Dominance" or other mega streaks in the GamifiedMatchRecording, they should receive digital badges/cards that go to their inventory for collection and display.

## Achievements to Award Badges

### Dominance Streaks
- **Total Dominance** (8+ consecutive points) → Mythic "Dominator" Card
- **Mega Streak** (5+ consecutive points) → Epic "Streak Master" Card  
- **Power Surge** (3+ consecutive points) → Rare "Momentum Builder" Card

### Match Achievements
- **Perfect Game** (11-0 or 15-0 win) → Legendary "Perfectionist" Card
- **Comeback Victory** (win after being down 7+ points) → Epic "Phoenix" Card
- **Clutch Win** (win by exactly 2 points) → Rare "Clutch Player" Card
