## üìâ **4. POINTS DECAY ALGORITHM**

### **Decay System Purpose**
Prevents point inflation, maintains competitive balance, and encourages regular play.

### **Proposed Decay Algorithm**

#### **Decay Parameters**
- **Grace Period:** 30 days (no decay)
- **Decay Rate:** 2% per week after grace period
- **Maximum Decay:** 50% of total points
- **Minimum Retained:** 25% of peak points (lifetime floor)

#### **Decay Calculation**
```
Weekly Decay = Current Points √ó 0.02
New Points = max(Current Points - Weekly Decay, Lifetime Peak √ó 0.25)
```

#### **Decay Examples**

**Example 1: Active Player (plays weekly)**
- Points: 150 ‚Üí No decay (regular activity)

**Example 2: Moderately Inactive (2 months no play)**
- Starting: 100 points
- After 30 days: 100 points (grace period)
- Week 5: 98 points (-2%)
- Week 6: 96.04 points (-2% of 98)
- Week 9: ~92 points
- **Result:** Minimal impact for short breaks

**Example 3: Long-term Inactive (6 months)**
- Starting: 200 points (lifetime peak)
- After decay calculations: ~100 points (50% maximum decay)
- Lifetime floor: 50 points (25% of peak)
- **Result:** Significant decay but maintains some standing

#### **Decay Protection**
- **New Players:** 90-day protection period
- **Returning Players:** 14-day re-activation grace period
- **Medical/Personal:** Admin can pause decay for documented absences
- **Seasonal Play:** Option for "seasonal mode" with reduced decay

### **Decay Implementation Benefits**
- Maintains active player rankings at top
- Prevents abandoned account point hoarding
- Creates natural ranking mobility
- Encourages consistent participation
- Balances between retention and competition

## üîß **5. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Age Group Detection**
```typescript
const getAgeGroup = (dateOfBirth: string): string => {
  const age = calculateAge(dateOfBirth);
  if (age >= 60) return '60+';
  if (age >= 50) return '50-59';
  if (age >= 35) return '35-49';
  return '18-34';
};
```

### **Point Calculation Engine**
```typescript
const calculateFinalPoints = (
  basePoints: number,
  ageMultiplier: number,
  matchTypeWeight: number,
  tournamentMultiplier: number
): number => {
  return Math.round(basePoints * ageMultiplier * matchTypeWeight * tournamentMultiplier);
};
```

### **Validation System**
The system includes comprehensive validation to ensure calculation consistency:

- **Test Coverage:** All age groups, match types, and tournament tiers tested
- **Edge Case Handling:** Zero points, maximum multipliers, decimal rounding
- **Audit Trail:** Complete transaction history for all point awards
- **Rollback Capability:** Admin can reverse incorrect point awards

## ‚ùì **REMAINING DISCUSSION POINTS**

### **1. Age Group Multiplier Application** üî• **CRITICAL DECISION**
- **Own Age Group:** Players get multiplier only when competing in their age division
- **Open Age Group:** Players always get their age multiplier regardless of opponent age
- **Impact:** Massive effect on competitive balance and point distribution
- **Your Recommendation Needed:** Which approach creates fairest competition?

### **2. Points Decay Refinement**
- **Proposed:** 2% weekly decay after 30-day grace period
- **Question:** Are these rates appropriate for recreational vs competitive players?
- **Consideration:** Should decay rate vary by player tier/activity level?

### **3. Pickle Points Conversion Rate**
- **Proposed:** 10x multiplier (3 ranking points = 30 Pickle Points)
- **Question:** Is this conversion rate engaging enough?
- **Alternative:** 20x or 25x multiplier for more substantial rewards?

### **4. Anti-Exploitation Strength**
- **Proposed:** Daily limits, cooldowns, fraud detection
- **Question:** Are proposed controls too restrictive or too lenient?
- **Balance:** Preventing abuse vs maintaining user experience
