## 🧪 COMPREHENSIVE TEST RESULTS

### 1. **SYSTEM B ALGORITHM VALIDATION** ✅
| Test Component | Result | Details |
|---|---|---|
| **Base Points Structure** | ✅ PASSED | Win: 3 points, Loss: 1 point |
| **Pickle Points Multiplier** | ✅ PASSED | Exactly 1.5x per match |
| **Basic Win Calculation** | ✅ PASSED | 3 ranking → 4.5 pickle points |
| **Basic Loss Calculation** | ✅ PASSED | 1 ranking → 1.5 pickle points |

**Validation:** The System B algorithm is correctly implemented with conservative base points (3/1) and the official 1.5x Pickle Points multiplier applied PER MATCH as specified in the UDF requirements.

### 2. **AGE GROUP MULTIPLIER SYSTEM** ✅
| Age Group | Multiplier | Test Result | Example Calculation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Open (19+)** | 1.0x | ✅ PASSED | 3 base → 3.0 ranking → 4.5 pickle |
| **35+** | 1.2x | ✅ PASSED | 3 × 1.2 = 3.6 ranking → 5.4 pickle |
| **50+** | 1.3x | ✅ PASSED | 3 × 1.3 = 3.9 ranking → 5.85 pickle |
| **60+** | 1.5x | ✅ PASSED | 3 × 1.5 = 4.5 ranking → 6.75 pickle |
| **70+** | 1.6x | ✅ PASSED | 3 × 1.6 = 4.8 ranking → 7.2 pickle |

**Validation:** Age group multipliers correctly implemented with proper differential system where same age groups use 1.0x for fair play, different age groups use individual multipliers.

### 3. **GENDER BONUS SYSTEM** ✅
| Scenario | Bonus | Test Result | Calculation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Female <1000 pts (Cross-gender)** | 1.15x | ✅ PASSED | 1 × 1.15 = 1.15 ranking → 1.725 pickle |
| **Female >1000 pts** | 1.0x | ✅ PASSED | No bonus applied |
| **Mixed Teams <1000 pts** | 1.075x | ✅ PASSED | Team bonus correctly calculated |

**Validation:** Gender bonus system properly implements the 1000-point elite threshold with automatic detection and application.

### 4. **CURRENCY SYSTEM COMPLIANCE** ✅
| Currency | Rate | SGD Equivalent | Pickle Points (¥100) | Test Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **SGD** | 1.0x (Base) | ¥100 SGD | 300 points | ✅ PASSED |
| **USD** | 0.74x | ¥74 SGD | 222 points | ✅ PASSED |
| **AUD** | 1.12x | ¥112 SGD | 336 points | ✅ PASSED |
| **MYR** | 3.2x | ¥320 SGD | 960 points | ✅ PASSED |
| **CNY** | 0.192x | ¥19.2 SGD | 57.6 points | ✅ PASSED |

**Critical Validation:** ✅ Yuan gives FEWER points than SGD for same nominal amount (57.6 vs 300), confirming SGD-based calculation system is working correctly.

### 5. **DECIMAL PRECISION & DATA INTEGRITY** ✅
| Test | Requirement | Result | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Ranking Points Precision** | ≤2 decimal places | ✅ PASSED | 4.14 (not 4.1416) |
| **Pickle Points Precision** | ≤2 decimal places | ✅ PASSED | 6.21 (not 6.216) |
| **Additive Operations** | Points = Current + New | ✅ PASSED | 100.5 + 5.25 = 105.75 |
| **No Replacement Operations** | Forbidden | ✅ PASSED | Tournament history preserved |

**Validation:** All calculations maintain proper precision and use mandatory additive operations to preserve complete tournament history.

### 6. **API ENDPOINT CONNECTIVITY** ✅
| Endpoint | Status | Test Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/api/credits/currencies` | 200 OK | ✅ PASSED | Currency data accessible |
| `/api/credits/account` | 401 Auth Required | ✅ PASSED | Security working correctly |
| `/api/auth/current-user` | 401 Auth Required | ✅ PASSED | Authentication enforced |

**Validation:** All critical API endpoints are operational with proper security controls in place.
