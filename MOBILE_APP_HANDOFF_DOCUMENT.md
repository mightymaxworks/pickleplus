## ⚖️ COMPREHENSIVE ALGORITHM SPECIFICATIONS

### **CRITICAL: PICKLE+ ALGORITHM COMPLIANCE - SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH**

**Algorithm Authority**: All calculations MUST follow `PICKLE_PLUS_ALGORITHM_DOCUMENT.md` specifications exactly. NO component-specific variations allowed.

### **System B Base Points - MANDATORY STANDARD**
```javascript
// REQUIRED: Use official constants only
const SYSTEM_B_BASE_POINTS = {
  WIN: 3,    // Conservative, sustainable scoring
  LOSS: 1    // Participation reward (33% of win)
};

// FORBIDDEN: Variable points, doubles bonuses, or streak bonuses
// Implementation errors to REMOVE: +0.5 doubles bonus, streak calculations
```

### **MANDATORY ADDITIVE POINTS SYSTEM** ⚠️ **CRITICAL COMPLIANCE**
```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT: Always ADD to existing career totals
UPDATE users SET ranking_points = ranking_points + new_points WHERE id = player_id;

// ❌ FORBIDDEN: Replacing/overwriting existing point balances
UPDATE users SET ranking_points = new_total; // DESTROYS TOURNAMENT HISTORY!

// Example: Player has 25.5 points, earns 8.2 → Final: 33.7 points (preserved history)
```

### **Age Group Multipliers - Differential System**
```javascript
const AGE_MULTIPLIERS = {
  'Pro': 1.0,       // Professional players (ignored in initial implementation)
  'Open': 1.0,      // Standard baseline (19+ adults)
  'U12': 1.0,       // Standalone youth system
  'U14': 1.0,       // Standalone youth system  
  'U16': 1.0,       // Standalone youth system
  'U18': 1.0,       // Standalone youth system
  '35+': 1.2,       // Early career professionals bonus
  '50+': 1.3,       // Masters division enhancement
  '60+': 1.5,       // Senior division significant boost
  '70+': 1.6        // Super senior maximum enhancement
};

// CRITICAL: Differential application
// Same age group: Both players get 1.0x (equal treatment)
// Different age groups: Each player gets individual multiplier
```

### **Gender Balance Algorithm - Elite Threshold System**
```javascript
// Gender multipliers ONLY apply in cross-gender matches for players <1000 points
const GENDER_MULTIPLIERS = {
  MALE: 1.0,           // Baseline competitive standard
  FEMALE: 1.15,        // <1000 points only in cross-gender matches
  MIXED_TEAM: 1.075    // <1000 points only, average composition
};

// Elite Threshold Logic (CRITICAL):
// - Players ≥1000 points: NO gender bonuses (proven competitive ability)
// - Players <1000 points: Gender bonuses apply in cross-gender competition
// - Same-gender matches: Always 1.0x for all players
```

### **Format-Specific Rankings - Separate Competitive Pools**
```javascript
// MANDATORY: Five independent ranking systems
const RANKING_FIELDS = {
  SINGLES: 'singlesRankingPoints',
  MENS_DOUBLES: 'mensDoublesRankingPoints', 
  WOMENS_DOUBLES: 'womensDoublesRankingPoints',
  MIXED_DOUBLES_MEN: 'mixedDoublesMenRankingPoints',
  MIXED_DOUBLES_WOMEN: 'mixedDoublesWomenRankingPoints'
};

// Points allocation by match type:
// Mixed vs Mixed: Men→mixed_men field, Women→mixed_women field
// Men's vs Men's: Both→mens_doubles field
// Cross-format matches: Each team→their respective fields
```

### **Pickle Points 1.5x Multiplier - PER MATCH CALCULATION**
```javascript
// CRITICAL: 1.5x applied PER MATCH when earned, NOT to total points
const PICKLE_POINTS_MULTIPLIER = 1.5;

// ✅ CORRECT: Per-match application
const matchRankingPoints = 3; // Win in tournament
const picklePointsEarned = matchRankingPoints * PICKLE_POINTS_MULTIPLIER; // 4.5 Pickle Points

// ❌ WRONG: Blanket conversion of total ranking points
const totalPicklePoints = totalRankingPoints * 1.5; // INCORRECT ALGORITHM!
```

### **Decimal Precision Standard - 2 Decimal Places**
```javascript
// MANDATORY: All point calculations use 2 decimal precision
const finalPoints = Number((calculatedPoints).toFixed(2));

// FORBIDDEN: Rounding or Math.ceil operations
const finalPoints = Math.round(calculatedPoints); // ❌ LOSES FAIRNESS
```

### **Complete Match Calculation Formula**
```javascript
// Official calculation sequence (EXACT ORDER REQUIRED)
const finalPoints = basePoints × ageMultiplier × genderMultiplier × tournamentTier × matchTypeWeight;

// Example: 60+ female vs 25-year-old male, Provincial Tournament
// Female winner: 3 × 1.5 × 1.15 × 2.0 × 1.0 = 10.35 points
// Male winner: 3 × 1.0 × 1.0 × 2.0 × 1.0 = 6.0 points
```

### **UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORK (UDF) BEST PRACTICES**

### **RULE 0: Mandatory Algorithm Validation Import**
```typescript
// REQUIRED: Every match calculation file must import
import { 
  validateEnhancedMatchCalculation, 
  createValidatedMatchCalculation,
  calculateDifferentialAgeMultipliers,
  calculateGenderBonus,
  SYSTEM_B_BASE_POINTS,
  PICKLE_POINTS_MULTIPLIER
} from '@shared/utils/algorithmValidation';
```

### **RULE 1: Pre-Calculation Validation Gates**
```typescript
// MANDATORY: Validate before ANY point allocation
const validation = validateEnhancedMatchCalculation(players, results);
if (!validation.isValid) {
  throw new Error(`Algorithm violation: ${validation.errors.join(', ')}`);
}
```

### **RULE 2: Cross-Gender Match Detection**
```typescript
// MANDATORY: Automatic detection and bonus application
const genderBonus = calculateGenderBonus(players, isEliteMatch);
// Automatically applies 1.15x for eligible female players in cross-gender matches
```

### **RULE 3: Multi-Age Group Ranking Updates**
```typescript
// MANDATORY: Update ALL eligible age categories
// Example: 42-year-old in Open tournament → Update both Open AND 35+ rankings
const eligibleCategories = getEligibleAgeCategories(player.age);
eligibleCategories.forEach(category => updateRanking(playerId, points, category));
```

### **PCP RATING SYSTEM - 55-Skill Assessment Framework**

### **Progressive Assessment Model**
```javascript
// 55-Skill Individual Tracking System
const SKILL_CATEGORIES = {
  TECHNICAL: 11,    // Groundstrokes/Serves
  TOUCH: 16,        // Dinks/Resets  
  POWER: 6,         // Volleys/Smashes
  ATHLETIC: 10,     // Footwork/Fitness
  MENTAL: 10        // Mental Game
};

// Category Weighting (Strategic Importance)
const PCP_WEIGHTS = {
  TOUCH: 0.30,      // Most critical for competitive play
  TECHNICAL: 0.25,  // Foundation skills
  MENTAL: 0.20,     // Separates good from great
  ATHLETIC: 0.15,   // Enables all other skills  
  POWER: 0.10       // Important but situational
};
```

### **Coach Level Weighted Assessment Algorithm**
```javascript
// L1-L5 Coach Influence Multipliers
const COACH_WEIGHTS = {
  L1: 0.7,    // Minimal influence - foundational assessment
  L2: 1.0,    // Standard baseline - enhanced technical knowledge
  L3: 1.8,    // 80% increase - advanced tactical understanding
  L4: 3.2,    // 220% increase - expert-level analysis  
  L5: 3.8     // 280% increase - master-level assessment authority
};

// CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: Only L4+ coaches provide CONFIRMED ratings
// L1-L3 coaches can only provide PROVISIONAL ratings requiring L4+ validation
```

### **Database Schema Requirements for Mobile**
```sql
-- Users table with format-specific ranking fields
CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  username VARCHAR UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  wallet_address VARCHAR,  -- Future blockchain integration

  assessment_status VARCHAR DEFAULT 'none', -- 'provisional', 'confirmed'
  
  date_of_birth DATE NOT NULL,
  gender VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Match recording with algorithm compliance
CREATE TABLE matches (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  match_type VARCHAR NOT NULL, -- 'singles', 'mens_doubles', 'womens_doubles', 'mixed_doubles'
  tournament_tier DECIMAL(3,1) NOT NULL, -- 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0
  
  -- Player points awarded (additive calculations)
  player_one_points_awarded DECIMAL(8,2) NOT NULL,

  age_multipliers_applied JSONB,
  gender_multipliers_applied JSONB,
  calculation_algorithm_version VARCHAR DEFAULT '4.0',
  
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### **Validation Utilities Implementation**
```typescript
// algorithmValidation.ts - MANDATORY UTILITIES
export function validateEnhancedMatchCalculation(players: Player[], results: MatchResult[]): ValidationResult {
  // Comprehensive pre-calculation validation
  return {
    isValid: boolean,
    errors: string[],
    warnings: string[]
  };
}

export function calculateDifferentialAgeMultipliers(players: Player[]): Record<string, number> {
  // Returns individual age multipliers per player
  // Same age group: all get 1.0x
  // Different age groups: individual multipliers apply
}

export function calculateGenderBonus(players: Player[], eliteThreshold: number = 1000): GenderBonusResult {
  // Automatic cross-gender detection and bonus calculation
  // <1000 points: Apply bonuses in cross-gender matches
  // ≥1000 points: No bonuses (elite threshold)
}
```

### **Error Prevention Protocols**
```typescript
// MANDATORY: Match calculation wrapper with full validation
export async function recordMatchWithValidation(matchData: MatchInput): Promise<MatchResult> {
  // 1. Pre-calculation validation
  const validation = validateEnhancedMatchCalculation(matchData.players, matchData.results);
  if (!validation.isValid) {
    throw new AlgorithmComplianceError(validation.errors);
  }
  
  // 2. Calculate with official utilities
  const calculation = createValidatedMatchCalculation(matchData);
  
  // 3. Apply additive point updates only  
  const updates = await applyAdditivePointUpdates(calculation);
  
  // 4. Audit trail logging
  await logAlgorithmCompliance(calculation, updates);
  
  return updates;
}
```
