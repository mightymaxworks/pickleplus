# Pickle+ UI/UX Framework (PKL-278651)

## 1. Core Development Principles

### User-Centric Design
- All features must enhance the user's pickleball journey
- Focus on reducing friction in user flows
- Design for both novice and expert pickleball players
- Prioritize features that motivate user engagement and progression

### Platform Performance
- Target initial page load under 2 seconds
- Optimize for lower-end mobile devices
- Implement code-splitting for larger feature modules
- Use smart loading strategies (lazy loading, preloading critical resources)

### Development Philosophy
- Component-driven development
- Test-driven UI implementation
- Feature flags for gradual rollout
- Focus on reusability and maintainability

## 2. Visual Design System

### Brand Identity
- Primary: #FF5722 (Pickleball Orange) - Primary actions, highlights, core branding
- Secondary: #2196F3 (Sport Blue) - Secondary actions, supporting UI elements
- Accent: #4CAF50 (Success Green) - Success states, progression indicators
- Special case: Gold accents (#FFD700) for founding members only

### Typography
- Headings: Inter (bold, semi-bold)
- Body: Inter (regular, medium)
- Monospace: Roboto Mono (for scores, statistics)
- Text hierarchy:
  * H1: 32px/24px (desktop/mobile)
  * H2: 24px/20px
  * H3: 20px/18px
  * Body: 16px/14px
  * Small: 14px/12px

### Iconography
- Use Lucide React icons as primary icon system
- Custom sport-specific icons for pickleball elements
- Icon sizes: 16px, 20px, 24px, 32px
- Interactive icons must have touch area of at least 44x44px

### Spacing System
- Base unit: 4px
- Spacing scale: 4px, 8px, 12px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px, 64px
- Consistent component padding: 16px
- Card padding: 24px
- Section spacing: 32px

## 3. Responsive Design Framework

### Breakpoint System
- XS: < 576px (Mobile)
- SM: 576px - 767px (Large mobile/Small tablet)
- MD: 768px - 991px (Tablet)
- LG: 992px - 1199px (Desktop)
- XL: â‰¥ 1200px (Large desktop)

### Mobile-First Philosophy
- Design and develop for mobile first, then progressively enhance
- Test all features on mobile devices before desktop
- Optimize touch targets for mobile interaction
- Implement bottom navigation and floating action buttons for critical actions

### Layout Patterns
- Mobile: Single column, 4-column grid with 16px gutters
- Tablet: 8-column grid with 24px gutters
- Desktop: 12-column grid with 24px gutters
- Use flexbox for component-level layouts
- Use CSS Grid for page-level layouts
- Maintain consistent content max-width (1200px)

### Responsive Patterns
- Card stacking on mobile, grid on larger screens
- Collapsible sections on mobile
- Bottom sheets instead of side drawers on mobile
- Fixed navigation on mobile, sticky on desktop

## 4. Component Architecture

### Component Hierarchy
- Atoms: Basic UI elements (buttons, inputs, icons)
- Molecules: Combinations of atoms (form fields, cards)
- Organisms: Functional groups (match recorder, leaderboard, profile editor)
- Templates: Page layouts
- Pages: Complete screens with business logic

### Component Guidelines
- Each component should have a single responsibility
- Implement proper propTypes/TypeScript interfaces
- Document component API clearly
- Include accessibility attributes
- Make all interactive components keyboard navigable
- Follow consistent naming conventions

### State Management
- Local component state for UI-only concerns
- React Query for server state
- Context API for shared UI state
- Clear separation between UI and business logic

## 5. Animation & Interaction

### Motion Principles
- Purpose: All animations must serve a purpose (feedback, guidance, branding)
- Timing: Quick for UI feedback (100-300ms), moderate for transitions (300-500ms)
- Easing: Use ease-out for entrances, ease-in for exits
- Performance: Prefer CSS transforms and opacity changes

### Interaction Patterns
- Show immediate feedback on all user interactions
- Implement optimistic UI updates where appropriate
- Add skeleton loaders for async operations
- Use subtle hover effects for interactive elements
- Implement pull-to-refresh on mobile lists

### Micro-interactions
- Button state animations
- Form field focus effects
- Success/error animations
- Achievement unlocked celebrations
- Rating and points animations

## 6. Accessibility Standards

### WCAG Compliance
- Target WCAG 2.1 AA compliance at minimum
- Ensure proper color contrast (4.5:1 minimum)
- Support keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- Implement proper focus management
- Use semantic HTML elements

### Screen Reader Support
- Add appropriate ARIA attributes
- Test with screen readers on both mobile and desktop
- Implement proper form labeling
- Ensure meaningful image alt text
- Use aria-live for dynamic content updates

### Inclusive Design
- Support text resizing up to 200%
- Design for color blind users
- Test with screen magnifiers
- Support reduced motion preferences
- Ensure touch targets are at least 44x44px

## 7. UI Patterns Library

### Navigation Patterns
- Bottom navigation for mobile
- Sidebar navigation for desktop
- Breadcrumbs for deep navigation
- Tab navigation for related content

### Data Display Patterns
- Cards for content containers
- Tables for structured data (responsive)
- Lists for sequential content
- Stats displays for metrics
- Charts and visualizations for data insights

### Input Patterns
- Forms with progressive validation
- Searchable select dropdowns
- Multi-step processes with progress indicators
- Editable fields with inline validation
- Multi-select options with toggle switches

### Feedback Patterns
- Toast notifications for transient feedback
- Modal dialogs for important actions
- Inline validation for form fields
- Progress indicators for long operations
- Empty states with helpful actions

## 8. Content Strategy

### Microcopy Guidelines
- Clear, concise, and conversational
- Consistent terminology across platform
- Pickleball-specific language where appropriate
- Avoid technical jargon
- Use active voice and present tense

### Content Hierarchy
- Progressive disclosure of complex information
- Important actions above the fold
- Group related content visually
- Use visual weight to indicate importance
- Implement clear visual scan patterns

### Loading States
- Skeleton screens for initial page loads
- Inline loaders for component-specific operations
- Global loading indicators for full page operations
- Meaningful loading messages for longer operations

### Error Handling
- Friendly error messages with clear resolution steps
- Inline form field validation
- System status messages
- Offline indicators and recovery options

## 9. Implementation Process

### Development Workflow
1. Define component requirements and API
2. Create component structure
3. Implement mobile-first styling
4. Add responsive enhancements
5. Implement interactions and animations
6. Test across devices and screen sizes
7. Validate accessibility
8. Document component usage

### Quality Assurance
- Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge)
- Mobile device testing (iOS, Android)
- Accessibility validation
- Performance benchmarking
- Responsive behavior validation

### Documentation
- Maintain this framework as living documentation
- Document component APIs clearly
- Include usage examples
- Note any accessibility considerations
- Provide responsive behavior notes
