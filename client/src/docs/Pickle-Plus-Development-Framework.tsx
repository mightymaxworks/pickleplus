# Pickle+ Development Framework

## System Overview

This framework establishes a standardized system of prefixed serial codes that categorize 
our development work across different domains. Each code represents a comprehensive set of 
requirements, implementation details, and best practices.

## Reference Code Categories

### 1. UI/UX Implementation (UI-XXXXXX)

UI codes reference our comprehensive design system and UI/UX principles. These include:

- UI-278651: Complete UI/UX Framework (our foundational design system)
- UI-XXXXXX: Specific UI/UX implementations (component designs, page layouts, etc.)

### 2. Feature Development (FT-XXXXXX)

FT codes reference specific feature implementations with detailed requirements:

- FT-123456: Feature Development Framework (our structured approach to building features)
- FT-XXXXXX: Specific feature implementations (match recording, tournament management, etc.)

### 3. Debugging & Maintenance (DB-XXXXXX)

DB codes reference our approach to debugging and system maintenance:

- DB-789012: Debugging Framework (our methodical approach to solving issues)
- DB-XXXXXX: Specific debugging or maintenance tasks (performance optimization, bug fixes, etc.)

## Reference Code Format

Each reference code follows the format:
[Category Prefix]-[6-digit Serial Number]

For example: UI-278651 or FT-123456 or DB-789012

## Usage Instructions

When referencing these codes in our communications:

1. Use the full code with prefix (e.g., "UI-278651")
2. To generate a complete implementation plan: "Generate the prompt for [code]"
3. To implement a feature using a specific framework: "Implement [feature] using [code]"

## Framework Details

### UI-278651: UI/UX Framework

Our comprehensive UI/UX framework covering:

1. Core Development Principles
   - User-centric design
   - Platform performance
   - Development philosophy

2. Visual Design System
   - Brand identity (colors, themes)
   - Typography
   - Iconography
   - Spacing system

3. Responsive Design Framework
   - Breakpoint system
   - Mobile-first philosophy
   - Layout patterns
   - Responsive patterns

4. Component Architecture
   - Component hierarchy
   - Component guidelines
   - State management

5. Animation & Interaction
   - Motion principles
   - Interaction patterns
   - Micro-interactions

6. Accessibility Standards
   - WCAG compliance
   - Screen reader support
   - Inclusive design

7. UI Patterns Library
   - Navigation patterns
   - Data display patterns
   - Input patterns
   - Feedback patterns

8. Content Strategy
   - Microcopy guidelines
   - Content hierarchy
   - Loading states
   - Error handling

9. Implementation Process
   - Development workflow
   - Quality assurance
   - Documentation

Using this code ensures consistent application of our design principles across the platform.

### FT-123456: Feature Development Framework

Our structured approach to developing new features:

1. Requirements Analysis
   - User story definition
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Technical constraints
   - Integration points

2. Modular Architecture
   - 4-Layer Architecture compliance (Database, Server, SDK, UI)
   - Module boundaries and interfaces
   - Clean separation of concerns
   - Cross-module communication patterns

3. Technical Implementation
   - Data modeling in shared/schema.ts
   - API design following RESTful principles
   - SDK layer abstractions for API communication
   - Component structure and state management

4. Development Approach
   - Test-driven development
   - Progressive enhancement
   - Performance considerations
   - Security measures

5. Quality Assurance
   - Unit testing strategy
   - Integration testing
   - User acceptance testing
   - Performance testing

6. Deployment Strategy
   - Feature flagging
   - Rollout approach
   - Monitoring plan
   - Rollback procedures

Using this code ensures a consistent, methodical approach to building new functionality that adheres to our modular architecture principles.

### DB-789012: Debugging Framework

Our methodical approach to debugging follows these core principles:

1. Root Cause Analysis (not symptom treatment)
   - Trace issues to their fundamental source
   - Identify the architectural layer where the issue originates
   - Understand the complete issue context and impact
   - Create reproducible test cases

2. Layer-by-Layer Investigation (respecting 4-layer architecture)
   - DATABASE: Examine data integrity, schema issues, query performance
   - SERVER: Analyze API endpoints, service logic, middleware issues
   - SDK: Review client abstraction layer, React Query implementation
   - UI: Inspect component rendering, state management, event handling

3. Comprehensive Documentation
   - Document the problem definition clearly
   - Record investigation steps taken
   - Note all findings, including what didn't work
   - Create technical documentation for the solution

4. Architectural Integrity Preservation
   - Ensure fixes maintain proper layer separation
   - Prevent cross-layer leakage of responsibilities
   - Apply fixes at the correct architectural layer
   - Follow established patterns for each layer

5. Thorough Verification
   - Unit test the specific fix
   - Test integration with adjacent components
   - Verify end-to-end functionality
   - Regression test related features

Using this code ensures we fix the root cause of issues while maintaining our architectural principles.

## Sample Prompts

Example of generating a UI implementation prompt:
"Generate the prompt for UI-278651 for the Match Center revamp"

Example of requesting a feature development:
"Implement user achievements tracking using FT-123456"

Example of requesting debugging assistance:
"Debug match recording validation issue using DB-789012"
