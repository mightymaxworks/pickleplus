# Pickle+ Development Framework

## System Overview

This framework establishes a standardized system of prefixed serial codes that categorize 
our development work across different domains. Each code represents a comprehensive set of 
requirements, implementation details, and best practices.

## Reference Code Categories

### 1. UI/UX Implementation (UI-XXXXXX)

UI codes reference our comprehensive design system and UI/UX principles. These include:

- UI-278651: Complete UI/UX Framework (our foundational design system)
- UI-XXXXXX: Specific UI/UX implementations (component designs, page layouts, etc.)

### 2. Feature Development (FT-XXXXXX)

FT codes reference specific feature implementations with detailed requirements:

- FT-123456: Feature Development Framework (our structured approach to building features)
- FT-XXXXXX: Specific feature implementations (match recording, tournament management, etc.)

### 3. Debugging & Maintenance (DB-XXXXXX)

DB codes reference our approach to debugging and system maintenance:

- DB-789012: Debugging Framework (our methodical approach to solving issues)
- DB-XXXXXX: Specific debugging or maintenance tasks (performance optimization, bug fixes, etc.)

## Reference Code Format

Each reference code follows the format:
[Category Prefix]-[6-digit Serial Number]

For example: UI-278651 or FT-123456 or DB-789012

## Usage Instructions

When referencing these codes in our communications:

1. Use the full code with prefix (e.g., "UI-278651")
2. To generate a complete implementation plan: "Generate the prompt for [code]"
3. To implement a feature using a specific framework: "Implement [feature] using [code]"
