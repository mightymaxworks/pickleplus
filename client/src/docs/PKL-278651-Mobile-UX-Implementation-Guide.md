import EnhancedMobilePassport from '@/components/passport/EnhancedMobilePassport';

<EnhancedMobilePassport
  onQuickAction={(action) => handleQuickAction(action)}
  onShareAchievement={(achievement) => shareAchievement(achievement)}
/>

// Enhanced Match Recorder
import EnhancedMobileMatchRecorder from '@/components/match/EnhancedMobileMatchRecorder';

<EnhancedMobileMatchRecorder
  onMatchRecorded={(match) => handleMatchRecorded(match)}
  onCancel={() => setShowRecorder(false)}
/>

// Enhanced Ranking Dashboard
import EnhancedMobileRankingDashboard from '@/components/ranking/EnhancedMobileRankingDashboard';

<EnhancedMobileRankingDashboard
  onViewFullRankings={() => navigate('/rankings')}
  onChallengePlayer={(playerId) => challengePlayer(playerId)}
/>

// Enhanced Coaching Interface
import EnhancedMobileCoachingInterface from '@/components/coaching/EnhancedMobileCoachingInterface';

<EnhancedMobileCoachingInterface
