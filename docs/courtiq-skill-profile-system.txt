## OVERVIEW

The CourtIQ™ Skill Profile System is a proprietary multi-dimensional rating framework designed to 
provide pickleball players with detailed insights into their strengths, weaknesses, and areas for 
improvement. Unlike traditional single-number rating systems, CourtIQ™ uses advanced statistical 
analysis of match data to generate a comprehensive skill profile visualized through an interactive 
radar chart.

## CORE COMPONENTS

### 1. Skill Dimensions

The system tracks and evaluates player performance across 8 key dimensions:

a) Serve Strength (SRV): Measures effectiveness of the serve as an offensive weapon
b) Return Accuracy (RET): Evaluates ability to effectively return serves
c) Net Play (NET): Assesses volleying skills and net control
d) Dinking/Soft Game (DNK): Measures control and consistency in soft-game exchanges
e) Power Shots/Drives (PWR): Evaluates driving and power shot effectiveness
f) Court Movement/Footwork (MOV): Tracks court coverage and positioning
g) Strategic Awareness (STR): Measures shot selection and tactical decision-making
h) Mental Toughness (MNT): Evaluates performance under pressure and focus

### 2. Rating Scale

Each dimension is rated on a normalized 0-100 scale:
- 0-20: Beginner 
- 21-40: Intermediate
- 41-60: Advanced Intermediate
- 61-80: Advanced
- 81-100: Elite/Professional

A composite CourtIQ™ Rating is calculated as a weighted average of all dimensions,
adjusted for match context and level of competition.

## DATA COLLECTION METHODOLOGY

### 1. Match Recording System

The Enhanced Match Recording System captures detailed performance metrics during match play:

a) Shot-by-Shot Tracking
   - Success rates for specific shot types
   - Error categorization (forced vs. unforced)
   - Positional data (where shots are made from and placed to)

b) Context-Aware Analysis
   - Performance in high-pressure points
   - Adaptability to different opponents
   - Effectiveness against different playing styles

### 2. Statistical Processing

Raw match data undergoes multi-stage processing:

a) Initial Calculation
   - Performance metrics are converted to dimension-specific scores
   - Example: 
     ServeStrength = (AcesPercentage × 0.4) + (UnreturnedServesPercentage × 0.3) + (ServiceWinPercentage × 0.3)

b) Opponent-Adjusted Calibration
   - Scores are weighted based on opponent skill levels
   - Win against stronger opponent in a dimension = larger improvement

c) Confidence Interval Determination
   - New players have wider confidence intervals
   - More match data narrows the confidence range
   - Displayed visually as thickness of radar chart lines

### 3. Progressive Rating Updates

Ratings update dynamically using exponential weighted averages:

a) Formula: NewRating = CurrentRating × 0.7 + MatchPerformance × 0.3

b) Recent matches have more influence than older ones

c) System becomes more "certain" about ratings as more data is collected:
   - Provisional status for first 5-10 matches
   - Established status for 11-30 matches
   - Mature status for 31+ matches

## TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### 1. Database Schema

a) player_dimensions
   - user_id (FK)
   - dimension_id
   - current_value (0-100)
   - confidence_interval
   - last_updated
   - matches_analyzed

b) dimension_history
   - user_id (FK)
   - dimension_id
   - value
   - timestamp
   - match_id (FK)

c) match_dimension_impacts
   - match_id (FK)
   - user_id (FK)
   - dimension_id
   - previous_value
   - new_value
   - impact_reason

### 2. API Endpoints

a) GET /api/courtiq/profile/:userId
   - Returns current dimension values and confidence intervals
   - Includes composite CourtIQ™ Rating

b) GET /api/courtiq/profile/:userId/history
   - Returns historical progression of each dimension
   - Supports date range filtering

c) GET /api/courtiq/profile/:userId/recommendations
   - Generates personalized improvement suggestions based on weakest dimensions
   - Links to training resources

d) GET /api/courtiq/profile/compare?user1=X&user2=Y
   - Provides side-by-side comparison of two players
   - Highlights complementary strengths for potential doubles partners

### 3. Update Triggers

a) Post-Match Processing
   - Dimension values update immediately after match validation
   - Players receive notification of changes

b) Periodic Recalibration
   - Daily batch processing to normalize ratings across player population
   - Weekly calculation of percentile rankings by dimension

## USER EXPERIENCE

### 1. Profile Creation

New players enter the system through one of these methods:

a) Guided Self-Assessment (provisional rating)
   - Years playing pickleball
   - Sports background
   - Self-reported strengths/weaknesses

b) Placement Matches
   - System analyzes 3-5 initial matches
   - Creates baseline profile with wide confidence intervals
   - Clearly labeled as "Provisional"

### 2. Profile Visualization

The primary interface is an interactive radar chart:

a) Visual Elements:
   - Octagonal shape representing 8 dimensions
   - Colored regions indicating strength levels
   - Confidence interval thickness
   - Historical overlays

b) Interaction Features:
   - Dimension tooltips with detailed statistics
   - Comparison toggle for friend/benchmark profiles
   - Time-based slider to view progression

### 3. Growth Tracking

Players can monitor their development through:

a) Dimension History Timeline
   - Chronological progression charts
   - Match impact annotations
   - Trend indicators

b) Achievements & Milestones
   - Dimension-specific achievement badges
   - Level-up notifications
   - Statistical percentile rankings

c) Improvement Recommendations
   - AI-generated suggestions based on skill gaps
   - Practice drills tailored to weakest dimensions
   - Partner recommendations for complementary practice

### 4. Social Integration

The skill profile facilitates community interaction:

a) Match-Making
   - Finds players with similar overall profiles
   - Identifies players with specific dimensional strengths for targeted practice

b) Team Formation
   - Suggests doubles partners with complementary skills
   - Team strength analysis for tournament participation

c) Community Benchmarking
   - Percentile rankings within age/region groups
   - Comparative progression rates
