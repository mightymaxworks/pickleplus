## Current Database Schema

The database schema follows module boundaries while maintaining relationships between entities:

### Core Tables
- `users`
- `passports`
- `profiles`

### Match/Competition Tables
- `tournaments`
- `tournament_registrations`
- `tournament_check_ins`
- `matches`
- `player_rankings`

### Achievements Tables
- `achievements`
- `user_achievements`
- `user_activities`

### Social Tables
- `connections`
- `coaching_profiles`
- `messages` (planned)

### Commerce Tables
- `redemption_codes`
- `code_redemptions`

- Define standardized interfaces between modules
- Create consistent API patterns across modules
- Implement event-driven architecture for cross-module updates

### Technical Standards
- Each module has dedicated database tables with clear naming conventions
- API endpoints grouped by module (e.g., `/api/social/`, `/api/commerce/`)
- Frontend components organized by module
- Consistent error handling and response formats
- Strong typing throughout the codebase

### UI/UX Consistency
- Shared component library across modules
- Consistent navigation patterns
- Module-specific sections maintain platform-wide design language
- Mobile-first approach throughout
- Accessibility standards maintained across all modules

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for module-specific logic
- Integration tests for cross-module functionality
- End-to-end tests for critical user journeys
- Performance testing for scalability
- Security testing for data protection

## Next Steps

1. Complete the essential features of the Core module
2. Finish the match recording and tournament system
3. Enhance the social connections framework
4. Implement the basic payment processing system
5. Begin developing the content management system
6. Create the initial admin dashboard

This modular architecture provides Pickle+ with a scalable foundation that can grow from a simple app to a comprehensive platform ecosystem.
