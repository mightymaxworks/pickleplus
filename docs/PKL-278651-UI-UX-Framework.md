# Pickle+ UI/UX Framework
**Reference Code: PKL-278651**

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive UI/UX framework for the Pickle+ platform, with a specific focus on the Match Center revamp. The reference code PKL-278651 can be used to request implementation of this design system without repeating the details.

## 2. Design System Architecture

### Core Principles
- **Mobile-First Design**: All components must be designed and tested first for mobile, then enhanced for larger screens
- **Consistent Visual Language**: Color scheme of #FF5722 (orange), #2196F3 (blue), #4CAF50 (green) with standardized component library
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Present only the most relevant information initially, with details available on demand
- **Performance Optimization**: Minimize bundle size, optimize resource loading, and implement lazy loading for heavy components

### Component Hierarchy
- Atomic Design methodology: Atoms → Molecules → Organisms → Templates → Pages
- Standardized props and interface definitions across related components
- Shared state management for cross-component communication

## 3. Responsive Design System

### Breakpoint Strategy
- XS: < 576px (Mobile)
- SM: 576px - 767px (Large mobile/Small tablet)
- MD: 768px - 991px (Tablet)
- LG: 992px - 1199px (Desktop)
- XL: ≥ 1200px (Large desktop)

### Layout Grid
- Mobile: 4-column grid with 16px gutters
- Tablet: 8-column grid with 24px gutters
- Desktop: 12-column grid with 24px gutters

### Touch Targets
- Minimum size of 44px × 44px for all interactive elements
- Padding between interactive elements of at least 8px

## 4. Animation & Interaction Guidelines

### Animation Principles
- Subtle animations for state changes (loading, success, error)
- Functional transitions for enhanced UX (page transitions, modal openings)
- Performance-minded with CSS transforms and opacity

### Interaction Patterns
- Swipe gestures for mobile navigation
- Pull-to-refresh for data updates
- Haptic feedback for important actions

## 5. Accessibility Standards

- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance as minimum standard
- Proper semantic HTML and ARIA attributes
- Keyboard navigation support
- Color contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1
- Screen reader compatibility

## 6. Match Center Implementation (PKL-278651)

### New Unified Match Dashboard

```tsx
// Component Structure
<MatchDashboard>
  <UserRankingSnapshot />
  <MatchRecordingFAB />
  
  <TabView>
    <Tab name="overview">
      <MatchStatsPanel />
      <CourtIQInsights />
      <RecentMatchesList />
    </Tab>
    
    <Tab name="rankings">
      <PCPRankingPanel />
      <RankingProgressChart />
      <RatingBreakdownCard />
    </Tab>
    
    <Tab name="history">
      <MatchFilterControls />
      <MatchHistoryTimeline />
    </Tab>
    
    <Tab name="validation">
      <ValidationQueueList />
      <ValidationGuidelines />
    </Tab>
  </TabView>
</MatchDashboard>
```

### Mobile Optimizations

1. **Floating Action Button (FAB)**: Replace the current "Record Match" button with a persistent FAB that's easily accessible on mobile

2. **Bottom Navigation**: Implement a bottom navigation bar for mobile users to easily switch between tabs

3. **Card-based UI**: Redesign all content cards to be fully responsive, with collapsible sections on mobile

4. **Touch-Optimized Controls**: Larger touch targets, swipeable cards, and pull-to-refresh functionality

### CourtIQ Integration

1. **Performance Insights Card**: Add a new component showing CourtIQ's analysis of player strengths/weaknesses based on match history

2. **Skill Radar Chart**: Visual representation of player skills across different aspects of pickleball

3. **Match Quality Metrics**: Display enjoyment and skill match ratings from previous matches

### PCP Global Rankings Integration

1. **Ranking Snapshot**: Compact version of the PCP Global Rankings card at the top of the match center

2. **Ranking Impact Preview**: Show potential impact on rankings before recording a match

3. **Multi-dimensional View**: Allow filtering of match history by different ranking dimensions (singles, doubles, age divisions)

### Enhanced Match Recording Flow

1. **Simplified Form**: Reduce the complexity of match recording with a step-by-step wizard

2. **Smart Defaults**: Pre-fill common values based on user history

3. **Real-time Validation**: Validate scores and match details as they're entered

4. **Opponent Suggestion**: Suggest recent or frequent opponents

## 7. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Mobile Optimization
- Restructure current match page to use responsive patterns
- Add bottom navigation for mobile users
- Implement floating action button (FAB) for match recording

### Phase 2: Component Integration
- Create the new unified Match Dashboard
- Implement the tab navigation system
- Develop mobile-optimized versions of existing components

### Phase 3: Feature Enhancement
- Integrate CourtIQ insights into the match center
- Add PCP Global Rankings components
- Implement the enhanced match recording flow
