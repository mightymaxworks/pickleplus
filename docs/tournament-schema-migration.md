# PKL-278651-TOURN-0006-MIGR: Tournament Schema Migration

## Overview

This migration addresses a critical issue where the tournament schema defined in code (`shared/schema.ts`) doesn't match the actual database structure. This discrepancy caused failures when trying to create tournaments using the admin interface.

## Migration Details

### Problem

The tournament table in the database has the following columns:
- id
- name
- description
- location
- start_date
- end_date
- image_url
- level

However, the code schema in `shared/schema.ts` defines additional columns:
- registration_start_date
- registration_end_date
- max_participants
- current_participants
- format
- division
- min_rating
- max_rating
- entry_fee
- prize_pool
- status
- organizer
- created_at
- updated_at

### Solution

The migration adds the missing columns to the tournaments table to align it with the schema definition, enabling the tournament creation functionality to work properly.

## Migration Process

1. **Schema Analysis (PKL-278651-TOURN-0006-MIGR-SCHEMA)**
   - Analyzed existing database structure
   - Identified missing columns based on code schema
   - Created migration plan with backward compatibility in mind

2. **Migration Execution (PKL-278651-TOURN-0006-MIGR-EXEC)**
   - Created migration script that adds missing columns to tournaments table
   - Implemented proper error handling and validation
   - Ensured backward compatibility

3. **Migration Testing (PKL-278651-TOURN-0006-MIGR-TEST)**
   - Created test script to verify migration success
   - Tested tournament creation with new schema
   - Verified existing functionality works

4. **Documentation (PKL-278651-TOURN-0006-MIGR-DOC)**
   - Created this documentation file
   - Updated component diagram to reflect new schema

## Running the Migration

Execute the migration with the following command:

```bash
npx tsx run-tournament-schema-migration.ts
```

Verify the migration was successful with:

```bash
npx tsx test-tournament-schema-migration.ts
```

## Rollback Procedure

If issues are encountered, rollback the changes by running:

```sql
-- This SQL script would need to be run using the execute_sql_tool
-- It removes all the newly added columns from the tournaments table

ALTER TABLE tournaments 
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS registration_start_date,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS registration_end_date,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS max_participants,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS current_participants,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS format,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS division,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS min_rating,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS max_rating,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS entry_fee,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS prize_pool,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS status,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS organizer,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS created_at,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS updated_at;
```

## Verification

After running the migration, verify that tournament creation works by:
1. Logging into the admin interface
2. Navigating to the Tournament Management section
3. Creating a new tournament with all fields
4. Verifying the tournament appears in the list and can be edited
