### Testing
- [ ] All unit tests passing
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] End-to-end tests passing
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet thresholds
- [ ] Security scanning completed
- [ ] Accessibility testing completed

### Database
- [ ] Database schema changes reviewed and approved
- [ ] Migration scripts prepared and tested
- [ ] Database backups in place
- [ ] Rollback scripts prepared and tested

### Environment
- [ ] Production environment variables documented
- [ ] Secrets rotation plan in place (if needed)
- [ ] SSL certificates valid and not expiring soon
- [ ] Required infrastructure provisioned
- [ ] Domain configuration reviewed

## Build Process

### Preparation
- [ ] Set `NODE_ENV=production`
- [ ] Run `node scripts/prepare-build.js`
- [ ] Verify server-only dependencies identified correctly

### Build Execution
- [ ] Run `npm run build:client` for frontend build
- [ ] Run `npm run build:server` for backend build
- [ ] Run `node scripts/post-build.js`
- [ ] Verify build artifacts in `dist/` directory

### Build Validation
- [ ] Client bundle size within acceptable limits
- [ ] All required assets included in build
- [ ] License information included
- [ ] No sensitive data in build files
- [ ] README and deployment instructions present

## Deployment Sequence

### 1. Database First
- [ ] Apply database migrations
- [ ] Verify database schema
- [ ] Run schema validation tests
- [ ] Backup production database after schema updates

### 2. Backend Services
- [ ] Deploy backend services
- [ ] Start server with `NODE_ENV=production`
- [ ] Verify server health checks
- [ ] Check logs for startup errors
- [ ] Verify API endpoints with smoke tests

### 3. Frontend Application
- [ ] Deploy static assets to CDN or server
- [ ] Update cache settings
- [ ] Purge CDN cache if necessary
- [ ] Verify assets loading correctly

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Health Checks
- [ ] Server responding to health checks
- [ ] Database connections stable
- [ ] Memory usage within expected range
- [ ] CPU usage within expected range

### Functional Testing
- [ ] Critical user flows working
- [ ] Authentication and authorization working
- [ ] Data retrieval and submission working
- [ ] Real-time features working (if applicable)

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Page load times within acceptable ranges
- [ ] API response times meeting targets
- [ ] Database query performance acceptable
- [ ] Resource usage (CPU/memory) within limits

### Security Verification
- [ ] HTTPS working correctly
- [ ] Security headers properly set
- [ ] Authentication tokens working
- [ ] Rate limiting functioning

## Monitoring and Alerting

- [ ] Logging configured and working
- [ ] Error tracking set up
- [ ] Performance monitoring active
- [ ] Alerts configured for critical metrics
- [ ] On-call schedule confirmed

## Rollback Plan

### Triggers for Rollback
- [ ] Critical functionality broken
- [ ] Security vulnerability discovered
- [ ] Performance degradation beyond thresholds
- [ ] Data integrity issues

### Rollback Process
1. [ ] Deploy previous version of application
2. [ ] Roll back database to previous schema (if needed)
3. [ ] Verify application functionality after rollback
4. [ ] Notify stakeholders of rollback

## Special Considerations for Pickle+

### Bounce Testing System
- [ ] Verify Bounce automated testing is functioning
- [ ] Ensure Bounce dashboard ticker messages are appearing
- [ ] Confirm Bounce findings database is accessible
- [ ] Test Bounce achievement tracking

### Tournament System

- [ ] Confirm media galleries
- [ ] Verify event scheduling and management

### XP and Achievements
- [ ] Test XP point accrual
- [ ] Verify achievement unlocking
- [ ] Confirm leaderboards update correctly

## Final Approval

- [ ] Product owner sign-off
- [ ] Technical lead sign-off
- [ ] Security team sign-off (if applicable)
- [ ] Stakeholder notification of successful deployment

## Post-Launch Monitoring

- [ ] 1 hour post-launch health check
- [ ] 24 hour performance review
- [ ] 7 day stability assessment
- [ ] User feedback collection and analysis
