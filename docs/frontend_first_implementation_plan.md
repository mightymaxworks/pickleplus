# Pickle+ Frontend-First Implementation Roadmap

**Document Created**: April 26, 2025  
**Author**: Pickle+ Development Team  
**Status**: Planning  
**Last Updated**: April 26, 2025

## Overview

This document outlines our comprehensive strategy to transition Pickle+ to a frontend-first approach with periodic database synchronization. This architectural shift aims to improve performance, responsiveness, and user experience by reducing API calls and providing immediate feedback.

## Current Issues

1. **XP/Level Calculation Inconsistencies**: Users with 814 XP were displayed as Level 1 instead of Level 6
2. **Unresponsive Profile Page**: Heavy API usage and inefficient rendering causing performance issues
3. **Excessive API Calls**: Many components make separate API calls for similar data
4. **Delayed User Feedback**: Users must wait for server responses before seeing updates
5. **UI/UX Limitations**: Current architecture limits advanced UI capabilities and animations

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Calculation Services (Sprint 1)

#### 1.1 Frontend Calculation Utility
- ✅ Create `calculateLevel.ts` utility for consistent level calculations
- ✅ Fix level display in Experience Points card 
- Add level calculation debugging and validation
- Unit tests for level calculation

#### 1.2 Data Calculation Service
```typescript
// client/src/services/DataCalculationService.ts
export class DataCalculationService {
  // Core data calculations
  static calculateUserLevel(xp: number): number { ... }
  static calculateXPProgress(xp: number, level: number): number { ... }
  
  // CourtIQ metrics
  static calculatePerformanceScore(stats: any): number { ... }
  static calculateMasteryLevel(metrics: any): number { ... }
  
  // Community metrics
  static calculateLeaderboardPosition(userScore: number, leaderboard: any[]): number { ... }
}
```

#### 1.3 Client-Side State Management
- Create React Context for derived data
- Implement hooks for accessing calculation results
- Set up caching mechanism for expensive calculations

### Phase 2: Profile Page Optimization (Sprint 1)

#### 2.1 Tab-Based Data Loading
```typescript
// In EnhancedProfilePage.tsx
const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState('overview');

// Only load data for the active tab
const { data: performanceData } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['profile', 'performance', userId],
  queryFn: () => fetchPerformanceMetrics(userId),
  enabled: activeTab === 'performance',
  staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // Cache for 5 minutes
});
```

#### 2.2 Virtualized Rendering
- Implement virtualized lists for match history
- Only render visible items in long lists
- Add progressive loading for performance-intensive components

#### 2.3 Frontend Caching
- Cache profile data to reduce repeated API calls
- Implement time-based cache invalidation
- Add loading states for uncached data

### Phase 3: Data Synchronization (Sprint 2)

#### 3.1 Create Sync Service
```typescript
// client/src/services/SyncService.ts
export class SyncService {
  // Queue for pending updates
  static pendingUpdates = [];
  
  // Add update to queue
  static queueUpdate(endpoint, data, priority) { ... }
  
  // Process queue based on priority
  static async processQueue() { ... }
  
  // Schedule periodic sync
  static setupPeriodicSync(intervalMs = 60000) { ... }
}
```

#### 3.2 Batch Update API
```typescript
// server/routes.ts
app.post("/api/batch-update", isAuthenticated, async (req, res) => {
  const { updates } = req.body;
  const results = await Promise.all(updates.map(async (update) => {
    // Process each update by type
  }));
  
  res.json({ results });
});
