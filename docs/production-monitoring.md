# Pickle+ Production Monitoring Guide

**Framework Version**: 5.3  
**Document Version**: 1.0.0  
**Last Updated**: April 22, 2025  

This document outlines the monitoring strategy for the Pickle+ platform in production environments. Proper monitoring is essential for maintaining system health, detecting issues early, and ensuring a positive user experience.

## Monitoring Categories

The Pickle+ monitoring strategy covers five key areas:

1. **System Health**: Basic server and application health metrics
2. **Performance**: Response times, resource utilization, and bottlenecks
3. **User Experience**: Frontend performance and user interactions
4. **Business Metrics**: Key performance indicators for the platform
5. **Security**: Anomalous activities and potential security threats

## Health Check Endpoints

The Pickle+ application provides several health check endpoints that can be monitored:

| Endpoint | Description | Expected Response |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| `/api/health` | General application health | 200 OK with status details |
| `/api/health/db` | Database connection status | 200 OK with connection pool stats |
| `/api/health/memory` | Application memory usage | 200 OK with memory statistics |

### Example Health Check Response

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2025-04-22T12:34:56.789Z",
  "environment": "production",
  "version": "0.9.0",
  "uptime": 12345.67
}
```

## Key Metrics to Monitor

### System Health Metrics

| Metric | Warning Threshold | Critical Threshold | Reaction |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|----------|
| Server CPU | >70% for 5 min | >90% for 2 min | Scale up or investigate high utilization |
| Server Memory | >80% | >90% | Check for memory leaks, scale up if needed |
| Disk Space | <25% free | <10% free | Clean logs/temp files or add storage |
| Process Uptime | <1 hour | <10 minutes | Investigate unexpected restarts |

### Application Performance Metrics

| Metric | Warning Threshold | Critical Threshold | Reaction |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|----------|
| API Response Time | >500ms avg | >1000ms avg | Optimize endpoints, check DB queries |
| DB Query Time | >200ms avg | >500ms avg | Review and optimize slow queries |
| Error Rate | >1% | >5% | Investigate error patterns in logs |
| Request Queue | >10 | >50 | Scale up to handle increased load |

### Database Metrics

| Metric | Warning Threshold | Critical Threshold | Reaction |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|----------|
| Connection Pool Usage | >70% | >90% | Increase pool size or investigate leaks |
| Query Cache Hit Rate | <50% | <25% | Optimize cacheable queries |
| Transaction Rollbacks | >1% | >5% | Investigate transaction patterns |
| Table Size Growth | >10% weekly | >20% weekly | Review data retention policies |

### User Experience Metrics

| Metric | Warning Threshold | Critical Threshold | Reaction |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|----------|
| Page Load Time | >2s | >4s | Optimize frontend assets |
| Client-Side Errors | >0.5% users | >2% users | Fix JavaScript errors |
| API Client Timeouts | >0.1% | >1% | Investigate slow responses |
| Session Duration Change | -20% | -40% | Investigate user engagement issues |

## Logging Configuration

### Log Levels

- **ERROR**: Critical errors requiring immediate attention
- **WARN**: Issues that don't affect overall functionality but require attention
- **INFO**: General operational information
- **DEBUG**: Detailed information for development (not used in production)

### Log Format

Production logs should follow this structured JSON format:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-04-22T12:34:56.789Z",
  "level": "info",
  "service": "pickle-plus-api",
  "message": "Request processed successfully",
  "request_id": "abc123",
  "user_id": 42,
  "path": "/api/match/record",
  "method": "POST",
  "status_code": 201,
  "duration_ms": 123
}
```

### Key Log Events

| Event Type | Log Level | Purpose |
|------------|-----------|---------|
| Application Start | INFO | Track application restarts |
| Request Completion | INFO | Track request patterns and performance |
| Authentication Events | INFO | Track login/logout patterns |
| Database Errors | ERROR | Detect database connection issues |
| API Errors | ERROR | Track failed API requests |
| Rate Limiting | WARN | Detect potential abuse |

## Monitoring Stack

### Recommended Tools

1. **Server Monitoring**: 
   - Prometheus for metrics collection
   - node_exporter for system metrics
   - Grafana for visualization

2. **Application Monitoring**:
   - PM2 for process management
   - Winston for structured logging
   - Pino for high-performance logging

3. **Error Tracking**:
   - Sentry for real-time error tracking
   - Log aggregation with ELK stack

4. **Uptime Monitoring**:
   - Healthchecks.io for regular ping monitoring
   - Uptime Robot for public endpoint monitoring

## Alerting Strategy

### Alert Channels

- **Immediate Action Required**: Phone call or SMS to on-call person
- **Needs Investigation**: Email and Slack message
- **Informational**: Slack message only

### Alert Rules

| Alert | Condition | Severity | Channel |
|-------|-----------|----------|---------|
| Server Down | Health check fails 3 times | Critical | Phone + Slack |
| High Error Rate | >5% error rate for 5 min | Critical | Phone + Slack |
| API Latency | >1000ms avg for 10 min | High | Slack + Email |
| DB Connection Issues | Pool usage >90% for 5 min | High | Slack + Email |
| Memory High | >85% usage for 15 min | Medium | Slack |
| Disk Space Low | <20% free | Medium | Slack |

### On-Call Rotation

For critical alerts that require immediate attention, an on-call rotation should be established with:

1. Primary on-call responder
2. Secondary backup responder
3. Escalation path for unresolved issues

## Bounce-Specific Monitoring

### Bounce System Metrics

| Metric | Description | Warning Threshold |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Bounce Test Success Rate | % of automated tests passing | <95% |
| Bounce Test Coverage | % of features covered by tests | <80% |
| Bounce Finding Count | Number of issues found | >10 new per day |
| Bounce Resolution Time | Time to fix Bounce findings | >48 hours avg |

2. User engagement metrics
3. Growth metrics
4. Key business KPIs

### Technical Dashboard

2. Implement log aggregation
3. Set up comprehensive dashboards
4. Add business metrics

### Phase 3: Advanced Monitoring

3. Set up automated scaling responses
4. Implement security monitoring

## Monitoring Best Practices

1. **Alert Fatigue Prevention**: Only alert on actionable issues
2. **Regular Review**: Review and update monitoring thresholds monthly
3. **Post-Incident Analysis**: Update monitoring after each incident
4. **Documentation**: Keep runbooks updated for alert responses
5. **Testing**: Regularly test alerting and on-call procedures
