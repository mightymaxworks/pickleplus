# PCP Global Ranking System - Casual Match Point Scenarios

## Casual Match Point System Overview

**Key Principle:** Casual matches contribute **match points only** to category-specific rankings, with no tournament points. Each casual match result is assigned to the specific format and division it was played in, maintaining complete category independence.

## Casual Match Point Structure

### Basic Point Values
- **Win:** +3 match points (in specific category)
- **Loss:** +1 match point (participation credit in specific category)
- **Format Assignment:** System determines format based on match participants
- **Division Assignment:** Based on player's age-eligible divisions and match context

### Category-Specific Assignment
Each casual match is recorded in ONE specific category:
- Format: Singles, Doubles, or Mixed Doubles
- Division: Determined by youngest player's age eligibility

## Scenario 1: Singles Casual Match Impact

### Player Profile: Marcus Thompson, Age 41
**Eligible Categories:** Open, 35+ (all formats)
**Current Rankings:**
```
Men's Singles Open: 0 tournament pts + 12 match pts = 12 total
Men's Singles 35+: 0 tournament pts + 9 match pts = 9 total
Men's Doubles Open: Not Ranked (no matches)
```

### Casual Match Event
**Match:** Men's Singles vs. 28-year-old opponent
**Result:** Marcus wins 11-9, 11-7
**Category Assignment:** Men's Singles Open (opponent age determines division)

### Point Calculation
```
Before Match:
Men's Singles Open: 12 total points
Men's Singles 35+: 9 total points

After Match:
Men's Singles Open: 15 total points (+3 for win)
Men's Singles 35+: 9 total points (unchanged)
```

**Key Insight:** The casual singles win only affects Marcus's Open division ranking, not his 35+ division ranking.

## Scenario 2: Cross-Age Division Casual Match

### Player Profile: Sarah Chen, Age 52
**Eligible Categories:** Open, 35+, 50+ (all formats)
**Match Context:** Mixed Doubles casual game

```
After Casual Win:
Mixed Doubles Open: 45 total points (unchanged)
Mixed Doubles 35+: 31 total points (+3 for win)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Match Point Assignment Algorithm
```javascript
function assignCasualMatchPoints(match) {
  // Determine format
  const format = determineMatchFormat(match.participants);
  
  // Find youngest player age
  const youngestAge = Math.min(...match.participants.map(p => p.age));
  
  // Determine eligible division
  const division = determineEligibleDivision(youngestAge);
  
  // Award points to specific category only
  const category = `${format}_${division}`;
  
  match.participants.forEach(participant => {
    const points = participant.won ? 3 : 1;
    awardMatchPoints(participant.id, category, points);
  });
}

function determineEligibleDivision(youngestAge) {
  if (youngestAge >= 60) return '60+';
  if (youngestAge >= 50) return '50+';  
  if (youngestAge >= 35) return '35+';
  return 'open';
}
```

### Category Independence Enforcement
```javascript
// Each casual match impacts only one specific category
function updatePlayerRanking(playerId, category, matchPoints) {
  // No cross-category influence
  // No point sharing between formats or divisions
  // Complete independence maintained
  
  updateDatabase({
    playerId,
    category, // e.g., "mens_singles_open"
    matchPoints: currentMatchPoints + newMatchPoints,
    lastUpdated: Date.now()
  });
}
```
