# Framework 5.3 Deployment Documentation

This document outlines the deployment process for Pickle+ under Framework 5.3, which enhances production readiness and deployment capabilities.

## Framework 5.3 Overview

Framework 5.3 builds on Framework 5.2 with a focus on production deployment and monitoring:

- Enhanced health check system with multiple endpoints
- Production database connection safeguards
- Environment-specific configuration handling
- Graceful shutdown and error recovery
- Replit-specific deployment optimizations

## Deployment Readiness Verification

Before deploying, run the verification script to ensure your application is ready:

```bash
node scripts/verify-production-readiness.cjs
```

This script checks:
- All required files are present
- Configuration is properly set up
- Health endpoints are functional
- Database safeguards are implemented
- Package.json scripts are correct

## Deployment Process

### 1. Prepare for Deployment

Run the Replit deployment configuration tool:

```bash
node scripts/replit-deploy-fix.js
```

This script:
- Creates or updates the `.replit` file with proper configuration
- Updates package.json with correct build and start scripts
- Adds a Replit-specific health check for deployment
- Updates database connection handling for production

### 2. Set Environment Variables

Ensure these environment variables are set in the Replit Secrets tab:

- `NODE_ENV`: Set to "production"
- `DATABASE_URL`: Connection string for the PostgreSQL database
- `SESSION_SECRET`: Secret for session encryption
- Other application-specific secrets

### 3. Deploy via Replit

Click the "Deploy" button in the Replit interface. Replit will:

1. Build the application using the configured build script
2. Deploy the application to a .replit.app domain
3. Set up required environment variables
4. Apply specified database configuration

### 4. Verify Deployment

After deployment, verify:

1. Health check endpoints:
   - `/api/health`: Basic application status
   - `/api/health/db`: Database connection status
   - `/api/health/memory`: Memory usage information
   - `/api/health/detailed`: Comprehensive system status

2. Access the app at your .replit.app URL to ensure it's functioning properly

## Monitoring in Production

Monitor your deployed application using:

1. Built-in health check endpoints
2. Replit Metrics dashboard
3. Database connection pool monitoring
4. Memory usage tracking

## Troubleshooting

If deployment fails:

1. Check the Replit deployment logs for errors
2. Verify all environmental variables are set correctly
3. Ensure the build script completes successfully
4. Check for module format issues (ESM vs CommonJS)
5. Verify database connectivity
6. Inspect logs for any runtime errors

## Recovery Procedures

If issues occur in production:

1. Check the health endpoints to identify the problem area
2. Review logs for detailed error information
3. Make necessary fixes and redeploy
4. For database issues, use the database health check for diagnosis

## Security Considerations

The Framework 5.3 deployment includes:

1. Environment-specific configuration to avoid exposing secrets
2. Database connection pools with proper error handling
3. Rate limiting for API endpoints
4. Secure session configuration
5. Proper handling of CORS and CSRF protection
