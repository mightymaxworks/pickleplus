# Pickle+ Pre-Launch Quality Assurance Checklist

## Overview
This checklist ensures the Pickle+ platform has been thoroughly tested before launch, focusing on key areas that need verification and validation to deliver a high-quality user experience.

## Automated Testing with Bounce
Bounce should primarily perform automated tests without requiring user intervention. The goal is comprehensive test coverage through automation while minimizing disruption to users.

### Automated Test Configuration
- [ ] Configure Bounce to run comprehensive tests during off-peak hours
- [ ] Set up periodic test schedules with configurable frequency
- [ ] Implement non-disruptive testing methods that don't interfere with user experience
- [ ] Configure detailed test logging and reporting
- [ ] Establish automatic notification system for critical test failures

## Critical Functionality Testing

### Authentication & User Management
- [ ] User registration works correctly with all required fields
- [ ] Login functions properly across all devices and browsers
- [ ] Password reset flow completes successfully
- [ ] User profile editing saves changes correctly
- [ ] Account deletion process works as expected
- [ ] Session handling prevents unauthorized access

### Core Functionality
- [ ] Match recording successfully saves data to database
- [ ] Match history displays correctly with accurate data
- [ ] Tournament brackets render properly and update after matches
- [ ] PCP Rankings calculate and display correctly
- [ ] Mastery Paths show appropriate status based on user data
- [ ] Community features (creation, joining, posting) work as expected
- [ ] Event management functions (creation, RSVP, notifications) work properly

### Mobile Experience
- [ ] All core functions work correctly on mobile devices
- [ ] Responsive design adapts appropriately to different screen sizes
- [ ] Touch interactions work as expected on mobile
- [ ] Mobile-specific features (swipe gestures, etc.) function properly

## Technical Health Checks

### Deadlinks & Navigation
- [ ] Automated crawl of all site URLs to identify broken links
- [ ] Verify all navigation elements (menu, breadcrumbs, buttons) lead to correct pages
- [ ] Check all external links to ensure they're valid
- [ ] Verify deep links function correctly (direct URL access to inner pages)
- [ ] Test back/forward browser navigation on all key user flows

### HTTP Error Pages
- [ ] Verify custom 404 page displays correctly and offers helpful navigation
- [ ] Check 500 error page handling and proper logging of server errors
- [ ] Test 403 forbidden page when accessing unauthorized content
- [ ] Verify network timeout handling with friendly error messages
- [ ] Ensure API error responses return proper status codes and messages

### Runtime Error Detection
- [ ] Monitor JavaScript console errors across all pages
- [ ] Check for unhandled promise rejections
- [ ] Verify error boundary components catch and display UI errors gracefully
- [ ] Test edge cases in forms and interactive elements
- [ ] Verify proper error handling with invalid inputs

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Measure and optimize page load times (target <3s for full page load)
- [ ] Check time-to-interactive for key pages
- [ ] Verify efficient API request patterns (minimize calls, proper caching)
- [ ] Test under various network conditions (slow, intermittent)
- [ ] Assess memory usage for potential leaks during prolonged use

### Security Checks
- [ ] Verify all user inputs are properly sanitized
- [ ] Check for secure transmission of sensitive data (HTTPS)
- [ ] Test authorization controls for proper access restrictions
- [ ] Verify protection against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF)
- [ ] Ensure proper validation of all API inputs

## Quality Assurance Checks

### Visual Consistency
- [ ] Verify consistent branding elements (colors, logos, fonts)
- [ ] Check all UI components follow design system guidelines
- [ ] Ensure proper spacing and alignment across all pages
- [ ] Verify dark mode implementation is consistent
- [ ] Check for visual bugs in component state transitions

### Content Quality
- [ ] Review all text for spelling and grammatical errors
- [ ] Ensure consistent terminology throughout the application
- [ ] Verify proper formatting of user-generated content
- [ ] Check for appropriate alt text on images
- [ ] Verify proper localization for any internationalized content

### Accessibility
- [ ] Test keyboard navigation throughout the application
- [ ] Verify proper heading structure for screen readers
- [ ] Check color contrast ratios meet WCAG standards
- [ ] Test with screen readers to verify compatibility
- [ ] Ensure all interactive elements have proper focus states

## Pre-Launch Final Verification

### User Flow Testing
- [ ] Complete end-to-end testing of primary user journeys
- [ ] Verify all critical business transactions complete successfully
- [ ] Test typical user journeys across different devices/browsers
- [ ] Verify proper handling of edge cases and error scenarios
- [ ] Test multi-step processes for correctness

### Database & Infrastructure
- [ ] Verify database backups are functioning properly
- [ ] Test recovery procedures for potential data loss scenarios
- [ ] Check database query performance under expected load
- [ ] Verify proper database indexing for common queries
- [ ] Test scaling capabilities for user growth

### Integration Points
- [ ] Test all third-party integrations for proper functionality
- [ ] Verify webhook handling for external services
- [ ] Test authentication with social login providers
- [ ] Check payment processing flows (if applicable)
- [ ] Verify email sending functionality

## Launch Day Preparation
- [ ] Prepare monitoring dashboard for real-time metrics
- [ ] Set up alerting for critical system failures
- [ ] Create response plan for potential launch issues
- [ ] Prepare communication templates for known issues
- [ ] Schedule post-launch check-ins to address emerging issues

## Post-Launch Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor error rates and user-reported issues
- [ ] Track key performance metrics (load times, server response)
- [ ] Watch for unexpected usage patterns that may indicate problems
- [ ] Monitor database performance and connection pool usage
- [ ] Track user engagement and conversion metrics
