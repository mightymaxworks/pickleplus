# Pickle+ - Comprehensive Ecosystem Platform

## Overview
Pickle+ is the central operating system for the global FPF (Future Pickleball Federation) franchise network, designed as a comprehensive ecosystem that unifies players, coaches, franchisees, headquarters, events, retail, facilities, and digital currency into one seamless and scalable platform. 

The platform serves multiple stakeholder groups:
- **Players**: From casual participants to competitive athletes, with both members and non-members
- **Coaches**: PCP-certified professionals with standardized training and performance tracking
- **Franchisees**: Business owners managing facilities, revenue, and local operations
- **FPF Headquarters**: Strategic oversight, compliance monitoring, and network growth
- **Facilities**: Physical locations requiring operational management and optimization
- **Retail Partners**: Equipment authentication, inventory management, and sales integration

The ecosystem emphasizes a unified player passport system, gamified loyalty through Pickle Points digital currency, and comprehensive franchise management capabilities while maintaining the core pickleball community and coaching development features.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Coach workflow preferences:
- Coaches should access training facilities to apply as facility coaches
- Profile management should use inline editing rather than separate page navigation
- Use "Coaching Bio" for coaching profile sections (not "PCP Coaching Certification Programme")

## Unified Development Framework
**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: All development must follow both modular architecture AND evidence-based completion standards.

### Modular Architecture Requirements
- ‚úÖ **80+ Specialized Route Modules**: Each feature has dedicated route file (`server/routes/feature-routes.ts`)
- ‚úÖ **Registration Functions**: All modules export proper registration functions  
- ‚úÖ **Authentic Data Integration**: Storage layer integration (no mock data)
- ‚úÖ **Clean Separation**: No monolithic route files allowed

### Development Accuracy Standards  
- Only schemas/API routes created = "Route Module Created" (NOT "Complete")
- Frontend + Backend implemented = "Implementation Phase" (NOT "Complete") 
- End-to-end tested and functional = "OPERATIONALLY COMPLETE"
- **Mandatory Development Dashboard**: `client/src/pages/CoachingWorkflowAnalysis.tsx` auto-tests all modular APIs
- All completion claims must include evidence (dashboard screenshots, API test results)
- **Real-time Validation**: Dashboard provides live status of all 80+ route modules

### Framework Integration Success (August 2, 2025)
- ‚úÖ **Modular Architecture Restored**: Abandoned monolithic approach, restored 80+ route modules
- ‚úÖ **Development Dashboard Active**: Auto-testing all APIs with real-time status indicators
- ‚úÖ **Evidence-Based Verification**: Dashboard shows authentic data flow from storage layer
- See `UNIFIED_DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md` for complete integration standards
