# Pickle+ - Comprehensive Ecosystem Platform

## Overview
Pickle+ is the central operating system for the global FPF (Future Pickleball Federation) franchise network, designed as a comprehensive ecosystem that unifies players, coaches, franchisees, headquarters, events, retail, facilities, and digital currency into one seamless and scalable platform. 

The platform serves multiple stakeholder groups:
- **Players**: From casual participants to competitive athletes, with both members and non-members
- **Coaches**: PCP-certified professionals with standardized training and performance tracking
- **Franchisees**: Business owners managing facilities, revenue, and local operations
- **FPF Headquarters**: Strategic oversight, compliance monitoring, and network growth
- **Facilities**: Physical locations requiring operational management and optimization
- **Retail Partners**: Equipment authentication, inventory management, and sales integration

The ecosystem emphasizes a unified player passport system, gamified loyalty through Pickle Points digital currency, and comprehensive franchise management capabilities while maintaining the core pickleball community and coaching development features.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Coach workflow preferences:
- Coaches should access training facilities to apply as facility coaches
- Profile management should use inline editing rather than separate page navigation
- Use "Coaching Bio" for coaching profile sections (not "PCP Coaching Certification Programme")

## Development Accuracy Standards
**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: Never claim features are "complete" without operational verification.
- Only schemas/API routes created = "Design Phase Complete" (NOT "Complete")
- Frontend + Backend implemented = "Implementation Phase" (NOT "Complete") 
- End-to-end tested and functional = "OPERATIONALLY COMPLETE"
- Single source of truth: `client/src/pages/EnhancedCoachingWorkflowAnalysis.tsx`
- All completion claims must include evidence (screenshots, test results, working URLs)
- **Mandatory Development Dashboard**: EnhancedCoachingWorkflowAnalysis.tsx serves as real-time progress tracker
- **User Journey Validation**: Each feature must include UX testing (happy path, error handling, mobile, accessibility)
- See `DEVELOPMENT_ACCURACY_FRAMEWORK.md` for complete standards
