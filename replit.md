User wants cross-gender matches to award points to respective singles/age group rankings with bonuses (1.15x women <1000 points, 1.075x mixed teams <1000 points).
User wants Match Card Ranking Display to show the highest category ranking for each player with enhanced MatchScoreCard component displaying "#[value] [category]" format.
User wants the admin integration at `/admin/match-management` to use updated MatchScoreCard components.
User wants the platform to be streamlined for core player functionality only in V1.0.
User wants advanced features disabled for the focused launch experience.
User wants navigation simplified to 4 core items: Dashboard, Record Match, Rankings, My Profile.
User wants interactive slider components for all 1-10 rating fields in the profile UX.
User wants all SelectItem empty value errors resolved across the platform.
User wants a comprehensive automated testing suite with Puppeteer, GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD.
User wants enhanced floating QR scanner button authentication logic to prevent display for non-logged-in users.
User wants `/admin/match-management` and `/admin/matches` to use `EnhancedMatchManagement.tsx` for match recording.
User wants fully standardized random passport code system (e.g., HVGN0BW0, KGLE38K4) across all components.
User wants automatic points calculation and allocation in match creation API.
User wants `QuickMatchRecorder` critical fixes related to JSX syntax, missing elements, SQL column name mismatches, missing imports, missing functions, and TypeScript compilation errors.
User wants `QuickMatchRecorder` admin functions to be enhanced versions of player components.
User wants standalone youth ranking system (U12, U14, U16, U18) fully implemented with complete category isolation from adult rankings.
User wants the EnhancedLeaderboard to follow the same logic as /rankings but with the new standalone youth system.
User wants automatic gender bonus detection and application in match recording system to ensure female players receive 1.15x multiplier in cross-gender matches under 1000 points.
User wants decimal precision (2 decimal places) instead of rounding up for ranking points to improve fairness and accuracy.
User wants decimal precision enforced in UDF best practices as the standard for all future development.
User wants the Pickle Points multiplier CORRECTED to exactly 1.5x throughout all documentation and system implementation - any other rate is incorrect.
User clarified that the 1.5x multiplier must apply PER MATCH when Pickle Points are earned, NOT as a blanket conversion of total ranking points.
User wants all assessment references standardized to 55-skill framework - COMPLETED across all coaching files (CoachDashboard.tsx, assessment-tool.tsx, CoachingAssessmentValidator.tsx, DetailedSkillAssessment.tsx, coaching-system-demo.tsx, and enhanced-coaching-landing.tsx).
User wants comprehensive CI/CD testing to verify: (1) Only coaches can see coach dashboard, (2) Coaches cannot rate themselves, (3) All features work 100% through UI - COMPLETED with full validation on August 20, 2025.
User wants L1-L5 coach weighted assessment algorithm with larger gaps between L2-L3 and L3-L4 (reflecting certification difficulty), minimal L1 influence (0.7x), and CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: All ratings remain PROVISIONAL until L4+ coach validation - only L4/L5 coaches can provide CONFIRMED ratings for official use.
