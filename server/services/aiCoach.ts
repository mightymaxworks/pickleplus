Based on your CourtIQ™ analysis, I've identified areas where you can improve your pickleball game.

STRENGTHS:
Your ${strongestArea.dimension} is your strongest attribute at ${strongestArea.score}/5. This gives you a solid foundation to build upon.

AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
Your ${weakestArea.dimension} (rated ${weakestArea.score}/5) needs the most attention.

SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. ${specificAdvice}
2. Build on your strong ${strongestArea.dimension} by incorporating it into your overall strategy.
3. Film yourself playing and review your matches to identify specific patterns that need adjustment.

PRACTICE RECOMMENDATION:
${drillSuggestion}

Keep tracking your progress using the CourtIQ™ system. Small, consistent improvements add up over time. Let's reassess in two weeks to measure your growth.
