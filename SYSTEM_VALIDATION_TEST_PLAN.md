# COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM VALIDATION - August 2, 2025

## TEST EXECUTION PLAN

### Phase 1: Critical Authentication Flow Testing
1. **User Registration Process**
   - New user signup via `/api/auth/register`
   - Password validation and storage
   - Session creation and persistence
   - Passport code generation

2. **User Login Process** 
   - Login via `/api/auth/login`
   - Session authentication
   - User data retrieval via `/api/user`
   - Protected route access

3. **Session Management**
   - Session persistence across page reloads
   - Logout functionality via `/api/auth/logout`
   - Session cleanup

### Phase 2: PCP Certification System Testing
1. **Certification Level Access**
   - API endpoint `/api/pcp-certification/levels` functionality
   - Level progression validation (L1→L2→L3→L4→L5)
   - User certification status via `/api/pcp-certification/my-status`

2. **Coach Application Process**
   - PCP coach onboarding workflow
   - Level-based commission structure
   - Certificate validation system

### Phase 3: Core Platform Features Testing
1. **Session Booking System**
   - Coach-player session requests
   - Session acceptance workflow
   - Payment integration with WISE

2. **Training Center Management**
   - QR code facility access
   - Center availability and scheduling
   - Location-based services

3. **WISE Payment Integration**
   - Payment processing endpoints
   - Coach payout system
   - Multi-currency support

4. **Admin Dashboard Functions**
   - User management capabilities
   - Coach approval workflows
   - System monitoring tools

## TEST RESULTS TRACKING

## RISK ASSESSMENT
- **HIGH PRIORITY**: Authentication must work for all other features
- **MEDIUM PRIORITY**: PCP certification affects coach onboarding
- **MEDIUM PRIORITY**: Payment integration affects revenue streams
- **LOW PRIORITY**: Admin functions affect management capabilities

## VALIDATION METHODOLOGY
1. **Automated API Testing**: Direct endpoint validation
2. **Frontend Integration Testing**: UI/UX workflow validation  
3. **Database Integrity Checking**: Data persistence validation
4. **End-to-End User Journey Testing**: Complete workflow validation
