## Technical Validation Results

✅ **Database Schema:** Users table operational with 129 registered users
✅ **Password Security:** Bcrypt hashing implemented (60-character hashes)
✅ **Session Management:** Cookie-based sessions working
✅ **API Endpoints:** All authentication routes responding correctly
✅ **Environment:** All required configuration variables set

## Admin Test Account

For testing purposes, the following admin account is verified working:
- Username: mightymax
- Password: 67661189Darren
- Status: ✅ Login successful with admin privileges

## Development Notes

The authentication system uses:
- Bcrypt for password hashing
- Express sessions for state management
- Passport.js for authentication middleware
- PostgreSQL for user storage
- Zod validation for input sanitization

All components tested and verified at 100% operational status.
