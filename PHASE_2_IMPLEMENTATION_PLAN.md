## Database Schema Updates

### Enhanced Classes Table
```sql
ALTER TABLE training_classes ADD COLUMN:
- detailed_description TEXT
- prerequisites TEXT[]
- equipment_required TEXT[]
- class_format ENUM('individual', 'group', 'team')
- intensity_level ENUM('beginner', 'intermediate', 'advanced', 'professional')
- program_id INT (for multi-week programs)
- session_number INT (for program sessions)
- minimum_enrollment INT DEFAULT 1
- optimal_capacity INT
- auto_cancel_hours INT DEFAULT 24
```

### New Coaches Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE coaches (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INT REFERENCES users(id),
  professional_bio TEXT,
  years_experience INT,
  certifications TEXT[],
  specializations TEXT[],
  teaching_style TEXT,
  languages TEXT[],
  hourly_rate DECIMAL(10,2),
  profile_image_url TEXT,
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### New Waitlist Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE class_waitlist (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  class_id INT REFERENCES training_classes(id),
  user_id INT REFERENCES users(id),
  position INT,
  joined_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  notified_at TIMESTAMP,
  expires_at TIMESTAMP,
  status ENUM('waiting', 'notified', 'expired', 'enrolled')
);
```

## API Endpoints to Implement

### Class Management
- `GET /api/classes/:id/details` - Enhanced class information
- `PUT /api/classes/:id/capacity` - Update capacity settings
- `GET /api/classes/by-skill-level/:level` - Filter by skill level
- `POST /api/classes/:id/waitlist` - Join waitlist
- `GET /api/classes/:id/waitlist` - Get waitlist status

### Coach Management
- `POST /api/coaches` - Create coach profile
- `GET /api/coaches/:id` - Get coach details
- `PUT /api/coaches/:id/availability` - Update availability
- `GET /api/coaches/:id/reviews` - Get coach reviews
- `POST /api/coaches/:id/certifications` - Add certification

### Enrollment Management
- `POST /api/enrollments/:id/transfer` - Transfer between classes
- `DELETE /api/enrollments/:id` - Cancel enrollment
- `POST /api/waitlist/:id/notify` - Send waitlist notification
- `PUT /api/waitlist/:id/convert` - Convert waitlist to enrollment

## UI/UX Components to Build

### Enhanced Class Detail Modal
- Comprehensive class information display
- Coach profile summary with ratings
- Capacity indicators and waitlist status
- Equipment requirements checklist
- Prerequisites verification

### Coach Profile Card
- Professional photo and credentials
- Specialization badges
- Student rating display
- Availability calendar
- Review excerpts

### Waitlist Management Interface
- Position indicator
- Estimated wait time
- Notification preferences
- Transfer options

### Capacity Management Dashboard
- Real-time enrollment tracking
- Waitlist analytics
- Auto-cancellation warnings
- Optimization recommendations

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- Students can view detailed class information including prerequisites and equipment
- Coach profiles display verified credentials and student ratings
- Waitlist system automatically manages enrollment when spots become available
- Minimum enrollment requirements trigger auto-cancellation warnings
- Mobile interface provides full functionality on touch devices

### Performance Requirements
- Class detail modal loads in <500ms
- Waitlist position updates in real-time
- Search and filtering responds in <200ms
- Mobile interface maintains 60fps during interactions

### Business Requirements
- Increase class fill rates to 85% average capacity
- Reduce no-show rates to below 10%
- Achieve 70% waitlist conversion rate
- Maintain coach utilization above 75%

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks
- **Database performance**: Implement indexing on frequently queried fields
- **Real-time updates**: Use WebSocket connections for waitlist notifications
- **Mobile performance**: Optimize bundle size and implement lazy loading

### User Adoption Risks
- **Feature complexity**: Implement progressive disclosure and help tooltips
- **Coach resistance**: Provide training materials and gradual feature rollout
- **Student confusion**: A/B test interface designs for optimal usability

## Next Immediate Actions
1. Start with database schema extensions for enhanced class details
2. Create API endpoints for class information management
3. Build enhanced class detail modal component
4. Implement capacity tracking visualization
5. Add skill level filtering functionality

This comprehensive approach ensures we build robust, scalable features that enhance the user experience while maintaining system performance and reliability.
