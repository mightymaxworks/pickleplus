## TECHNICAL VALIDATION EVIDENCE

### Authentication Flow Test:
```bash
# Registration Success
POST /api/auth/register → 201 Created
User: systemtest (ID: 212, Passport: TXEZVY)

# Login Success  
POST /api/auth/login → 200 OK
Session established with cookies

# Protected Route Access
GET /api/user → 200 OK
Returns complete authenticated user profile
```

### API Endpoint Health Check:
```bash
GET /api/pcp → 200 OK (version 1.0.0)
GET /api/coach-hub → 200 OK (operational)
GET /api/session-booking → 200 OK (operational)
GET /api/training-centers → 200 OK (operational)
GET /api/qr → 200 OK (operational)
GET /api/wise → 200 OK (operational)
GET /api/pcp-certification/levels → 200 OK (5 levels returned)
GET /api/pcp-certification/my-status → 200 OK (user progress data)
```

## IMPACT ASSESSMENT
