# Tournament Admin Dashboard - Backup Protection Strategy
## Date: 2025-06-02

### Files Backed Up Before Hierarchy Redesign:
1. `TournamentAdminDashboard.tsx` â†’ `TournamentAdminDashboard.backup.tsx`

### Functionality That MUST BE PRESERVED:
1. **Tournament Creation Button** - "Create Tournament" button in header
2. **Tournament Creation Modal** - All 3 tournament type options:
   - Single Tournament
   - Multi-Event Tournament 
   - Team Tournament
3. **Tournament Creation Wizards**:
   - Single tournament form (all steps and fields)
   - Multi-event tournament form (parent + sub-events)
   - Team tournament form (team structure, eligibility rules)
4. **API Endpoints** - All existing tournament CRUD operations
5. **Tournament Status Management** - Status updates and filtering
6. **Tournament Cards** - Basic tournament information display

### What We Will Change (UI/Display Only):
1. **Layout Structure** - Better hierarchy visualization
2. **Grouping and Organization** - Group by tournament type
3. **Visual Design** - Cleaner cards, better spacing
4. **Navigation/Filtering** - Enhanced search and filters

### Protection Strategy:
- Backup file created as safety net
- Only modify display/layout components
- Keep all existing state management
- Preserve all existing props and data flow
- Test each change incrementally

### Rollback Plan:
If anything breaks, restore from backup:
```bash
cp TournamentAdminDashboard.backup.tsx TournamentAdminDashboard.tsx
```
