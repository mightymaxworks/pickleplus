# Win Percentage Fix - Comprehensive System Repair

**Date:** August 20, 2025
**Issue:** Players with ranking points but 0% win percentage due to missing match statistics

## Problem Analysis

**Root Cause:** The match recording system was updating ranking points and pickle points but **NOT updating user match statistics** (`total_matches` and `matches_won` fields).

**Evidence:**
- Many players have substantial ranking points but 0 total matches recorded
- Examples: Player 263 (44.40 points, 0 matches), Player 262 (23.46 points, 0 matches)
- Win percentage calculation shows 0% despite having earned points from wins

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Fixed Match Recording System**
- **Added new method:** `updateUserMatchStatistics(userId, isWinner)` in storage.ts
- **Integrated into match routes:** Both enhanced calculation service AND fallback now update match statistics
- **Winner tracking:** Winners get +1 total matches AND +1 matches won
- **Loser tracking:** Losers get +1 total matches only

### 2. **Data Repair Strategy**
Need to recalculate match statistics for existing players based on their historical match data.

### 3. **System Verification**
Will test with new matches to ensure the fix works going forward.

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Test new match recording to verify statistics update correctly
2. **Data Repair:** Run comprehensive repair script for existing players
3. **Validation:** Verify win percentages calculate correctly after repair

**Status:** Implementation complete, testing required
**Critical:** This fixes the core win percentage calculation issue system-wide
