# PickleJourney™ Implementation Plan v2.0

## Project Overview

PickleJourney™ is evolving from a simple journaling tool into a comprehensive personal growth center that serves as both an onboarding experience and a tool for ongoing development. The system leverages emotional intelligence and now supports multiple user roles within the pickleball ecosystem.

## Core Features

1. **Multi-Role Journey System**
   - Support for users with multiple roles (Player, Coach, Referee, etc.)
   - Role prioritization and perspective switching
   - Role-specific content and visualization
   - Cross-role insights and connections

2. **Emotionally Intelligent Journaling**
   - Emotion detection through self-reporting and language analysis
   - Adaptive UI based on emotional state
   - Emotional pattern visualization
   - Context-sensitive journaling prompts

3. **Journey Visualization**
   - Interactive timeline of pickleball development
   - Role-color-coded events and milestones
   - Emotional overlays on performance data
   - Progress tracking across multiple dimensions

4. **Personalized Onboarding**
   - Multi-role discovery and prioritization
   - "Your Why" exploration for each role
   - Goal setting with role context
   - Progressive feature introduction

## Technical Architecture

The PickleJourney™ system follows a modular architecture:

```
client/src/modules/picklejourney/
├── components/   # UI Components
├── hooks/        # Custom React hooks
├── contexts/     # Context providers
├── utils/        # Utility functions
├── services/     # Service layers
├── types.ts      # Type definitions
└── index.ts      # Main exports
```

### Database Schema

The PickleJourney™ system extends the existing user roles system with additional metadata:

```typescript
// Journey-specific user metadata
export interface JourneyMetadata {
  rolePreferences: {
    roles: UserRole[];          // All selected roles
    primaryRole: UserRole;      // Primary role focus
    roleWhys: Record<UserRole, string>; // Why for each role
  };
  onboardingStatus: {
    completed: boolean;
    lastStep: string;
    completedSteps: string[];
  };
  journeyProgress: {
    milestones: JourneyMilestone[];
    currentLevel: number;
    roleSpecificLevels: Record<UserRole, number>;
  };
}

// Role-specific journal entry extensions
export interface JournalEntryExtended extends JournalEntry {
  roles: UserRole[];           // Roles relevant to this entry
  primaryRole: UserRole;       // Primary role perspective 
  crossRoleInsights?: string;  // Insights across roles
  emotionalState: EmotionalState;
}
```

## Integration with Existing Systems

The PickleJourney™ system will integrate with:

1. **User Role System**
   - Leverage existing role database schema
   - Extend with role prioritization
   - Add role-specific metadata

2. **Match History System**
   - Match results trigger contextual journal prompts
   - Emotional responses linked to match statistics
   - Performance analysis includes emotional and role context

3. **CourtIQ Rating System**
   - Mental toughness dimension directly informed by emotional intelligence
   - Role-specific performance metrics
   - Visualization shows connection between emotional growth and rating

4. **SAGE AI Assistant**
   - SAGE analyzes journal content for insights
   - Provides role-contextual responses
   - Surfaces relevant past experiences
   - Connects patterns across roles

5. **Coaching Ecosystem**
   - Coaches gain insight into student emotional patterns
   - Shared journal entries facilitate focused development
   - Role transition support (Player to Coach)

## Implementation Approach

1. **Frontend-First Development**
   - Build client-side UI and interactions first
   - Use local storage for early prototyping
   - Add server persistence once interfaces are stable

2. **Parallel Path Experience**
   - Maintain separate routes for existing and new dashboard
   - Preserve all current functionality
   - Allow graceful transition between experiences

3. **Progressive Enhancement**
   - Start with core role management system
   - Add features incrementally
   - Continuously validate with real users

4. **Separate Implementation Path**
   - Keep the PickleJourney™ system at `/journey` route
   - Ensure no interference with existing dashboard
   - Provide clear navigation between experiences

## User Experience Goals

1. **Intuitive Multi-Role Management**
   - Clear role selection and prioritization
   - Seamless perspective switching
   - Visual differentiation between roles

2. **Emotionally Responsive Interface**
   - UI adapts to detected emotional state
   - Color schemes shift with mood
   - Content recommendations based on emotional patterns

3. **Holistic Journey Visualization**
   - See complete pickleball journey across all roles
   - Understand connections between roles
   - Identify patterns and growth opportunities

4. **Personalized Growth Path**
   - Custom recommendations based on role combination
   - Targeted development opportunities
   - Role-specific goal setting and tracking

## Success Metrics

1. **Engagement Metrics**
   - Time spent on journey dashboard
   - Frequency of journal entries
   - Multiple role adoption rate

2. **Qualitative Metrics**
   - User satisfaction with role management
   - Emotional connection to journey visualization
   - Perceived value of cross-role insights

3. **Growth Metrics**
   - Completion of journey milestones
   - Progress on role-specific goals
   - Skill development across roles

## Next Steps

1. Implement core role management system
2. Build the role discovery wizard
3. Create the adaptive journey dashboard
4. Enhance emotion detection with role context
