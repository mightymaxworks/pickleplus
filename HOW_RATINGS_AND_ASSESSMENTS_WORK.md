# How Ratings and Assessments Work in Pickle+

## For Coaches and Players: A Simple Guide

### 🎯 What You Need to Know First

**Your PCP Rating** is your official skill level (like 4.2 or 5.7) that shows how good you are at pickleball. It's calculated from detailed assessments of 55 specific skills that coaches evaluate during your training sessions.

**The Big Picture**: You don't need to assess all 55 skills every time. Coaches can focus on just the skills you're working on (like dinks), and your overall rating will update automatically.

## 🔍 How Individual Skills Work

### Every Skill Has Its Own Score
- Each of the 55 pickleball skills gets rated from 1-10
- Your rating for "Forehand Topspin Dink" is separate from "Serve Power"
- These individual ratings stay in the system and update when reassessed
- Your overall PCP rating combines all these individual skills using a smart formula

### Example: Your Skill Journey
```
January: Coach assesses all 55 skills → PCP Rating: 4.2
February: Dinks training → Only dink skills updated → PCP Rating: 4.4
March: Serve clinic → Only serve skills updated → PCP Rating: 4.3
April: Volleys practice → Only volley skills updated → PCP Rating: 4.6
```

**Key Point**: Your old skill ratings don't disappear. They stay in your profile until the coach updates them again.
