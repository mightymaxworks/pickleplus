# Pickle+ Enhanced Deployment Guide

This guide provides instructions for deploying the Enhanced version of Pickle+ which offers a more polished and feature-rich experience than the basic deployment.

## Solution Overview

I've created an **Enhanced Build** approach that:

1. Creates a beautiful React-like dashboard using modern web technologies
2. Properly connects to the PostgreSQL database
3. Provides all the key API endpoints needed for the application
4. Features a responsive design that works on all devices

## What Makes This Different

Unlike the previous deployment approaches:

1. **Beautiful UI** - This version includes a fully styled, interactive dashboard with all main app sections
2. **Client-Side Routing** - Includes proper client-side navigation between sections
3. **Loading States** - Shows loading indicators and graceful transitions
4. **Data Visualization** - Includes charts and metrics visualizations
5. **Comprehensive API** - All key API endpoints are fully implemented

## Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Run the Enhanced Build Script

```bash
chmod +x enhanced-build.sh
./enhanced-build.sh
```

This script:
- Creates the ES module server file (prod-server.js)
- Generates a beautiful client interface with React-like components
- Sets up all necessary API endpoints
- Configures database connection with proper error handling

### Step 2: Configure Replit Deployment

In the Replit deployment interface:

- **Build Command**:
  ```
  bash enhanced-build.sh
  ```
  
- **Run Command**:
  ```
  node prod-server.js
  ```

### Step 3: Deploy

Click the "Deploy" button in the Replit interface.

## Testing Locally

You can test the deployment locally by running:

```bash
node prod-server.js
```

You should see output like:
```

```

Then open a browser to [http://localhost](http://localhost) to see the app.

## Features Included

All components are properly styled and include:
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Interactive elements like dropdowns and navigation
- Loading states and transitions
- Data visualizations
- Toast notifications

## API Endpoints

The following API endpoints are implemented:

- `/api/health` - Server health check
- `/api/auth/current-user` - Current user information
- `/api/leaderboard` - Player rankings
- `/api/match/history` - Complete match history
- `/api/match/recent` - Recent matches
- `/api/tournaments` - Tournament listings
- `/api/user/rating-detail` - Detailed user rating information
- `/api/courtiq/performance` - Performance metrics

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Port Conflict** - Make sure port 80 is available or change the PORT environment variable
2. **Database Connection** - Verify your DATABASE_URL is correctly set
3. **Missing Assets** - All assets should be in the public/assets directory
4. **API Errors** - Check the server logs for detailed error information
