# Pickle+ Deployment Readiness Checklist

## Core Configuration
- [ ] Server port is set to 8080 for Cloud Run compatibility
- [ ] Environment variables are properly configured in .env file
- [ ] Database connection strings are using Neon Serverless PostgreSQL format
- [ ] Node.js version is compatible with Replit (Node.js 18+)

## Server Component Checks
- [ ] Server starts without errors in development mode
- [ ] API endpoints return expected responses
- [ ] Special routes are properly registered and functioning
- [ ] Health check endpoints return 200 OK
- [ ] Database connections are established successfully
- [ ] WebSocket connections initialize correctly
- [ ] Session management is working properly
- [ ] User authentication flow functions as expected

## Client Component Checks
- [ ] Client builds without errors or warnings
- [ ] React components render as expected
- [ ] CSS and styling is applied correctly
- [ ] Images and assets are loading properly
- [ ] Authentication UI works as expected
- [ ] Forms submit data correctly
- [ ] Navigation and routing works as expected
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness is functioning properly

## Deployment Preparation
- [ ] Package.json contains correct dependencies
- [ ] No unnecessary Node.js native modules in client imports
- [ ] Performance-hooks usage is properly isolated to server-side
- [ ] Build script handles server/client separation correctly
- [ ] Port configuration is properly set for deployment
- [ ] No hardcoded development URLs in the codebase

## Security Considerations
- [ ] CSRF protection is enabled
- [ ] API endpoints validate input properly
- [ ] Authentication checks are in place for protected routes
- [ ] No sensitive information in client-side code
- [ ] Database credentials are properly secured
- [ ] Session cookies have proper security settings

## Deployment Settings
- [ ] Build Command: `npm install`
- [ ] Run Command: `npx tsx server/index.ts`
- [ ] Environment variables are set in Replit Secrets
- [ ] Database connection string is configured in environment

## Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Server starts successfully in production
- [ ] API endpoints are accessible
- [ ] Database connections work in production
- [ ] Authentication flows work end-to-end
- [ ] Static assets load correctly
- [ ] Performance is acceptable

## Troubleshooting Guide
- If server fails to start: Check port configuration and logs
- If database connection fails: Verify DATABASE_URL and Neon connection
- If client doesn't load: Check for build errors in the console
- If API returns 404: Verify routes are registered correctly
- If authentication fails: Check session configuration

## Important Files to Check
- `server/index.ts`: Ensure port is set to 8080
- `server/routes.ts`: Verify all routes are registered
- `server/db.ts`: Check database connection configuration
- `.env`: Verify environment variables
- `package.json`: Check dependencies and scripts
