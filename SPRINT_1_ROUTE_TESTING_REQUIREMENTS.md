# Sprint 1: Curriculum Management & Lesson Planning - Route Testing Requirements

## Overview
This document defines the complete route testing requirements for Sprint 1's curriculum management system. These tests validate 100% backend infrastructure readiness for the coaching UX enhancement ecosystem.

## Testing Methodology
- **Tool**: curl with JSON response validation
- **Authentication**: Test with placeholder coach ID (1) until auth middleware integration
- **Success Criteria**: All routes return proper JSON responses with success/error handling
- **Validation Level**: Full CRUD operations with data persistence verification

## Test Execution Commands

### Rapid Validation Script
```bash
# Test core drill functionality
curl -s "http://localhost:5000/api/curriculum/drills" | jq '.success'
curl -s "http://localhost:5000/api/curriculum/categories" | jq '.success'

# Test template system
curl -s "http://localhost:5000/api/curriculum/templates" | jq '.success'

# Test lesson planning
curl -s "http://localhost:5000/api/curriculum/lesson-plans/my-plans" | jq '.success'

# Test session goals
curl -s "http://localhost:5000/api/curriculum/session-goals/coach" | jq '.success'
```

### Expected Output for 100% Readiness
All commands should return: `true`

## Next Steps After Validation

Upon achieving 100% route readiness:
1. **Sprint 2 Initiation**: Begin student progress tracking system
2. **Frontend Integration**: Connect React components to validated API
3. **Authentication Enhancement**: Integrate coach authentication middleware
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Implement response time tracking
5. **Data Seeding**: Populate with authentic PCP drill content

## Notes
- This document serves as the definitive Sprint 1 completion checkpoint
- All routes must pass validation before Sprint 2 commencement  
- Authentication middleware integration deferred to maintain development velocity
- PCP rating system (2.0-8.0) fully integrated across all drill management endpoints
