# PKL-278651-TEAM-0001 - Flexible Team Event CRUD System Implementation Guide

**Status**: IN PROGRESS  
**Framework**: 5.3  
**Date**: 2025-06-01  
**Priority**: HIGH  

## Overview

Building a flexible team event management system that supports variable team sizes (2-8+ players), configurable constraints, and diverse tournament formats beyond traditional doubles.

## Completed Components

### âœ… Database Schema
- **team_event_templates**: Reusable configurations for different tournament formats
- **team_event_constraints**: Flexible rule engine for team validation  
- **teams**: Team instances for specific tournaments
- **team_members**: Player assignments with roles and positions
- **Enums**: team_status, team_member_role, constraint_type

### âœ… User Scenarios Documented
1. **Corporate Tournament**: 6-8 players, no skill restrictions, rotation format
2. **Elite League**: 2 players + substitute, strict skill matching
3. **Community Recreation**: 2-4 flexible players, beginner-friendly
4. **Multi-Format Series**: Variable formats by month/season

### âœ… Constraint Types Designed
- `no_repeat_players`: Prevent duplicate players across teams
- `skill_level_range`: Enforce skill compatibility within teams  
- `gender_requirement`: Gender ratio requirements for mixed events
- `age_requirement`: Age-based team constraints
- `organization_limit`: Corporate/club restrictions
- `custom`: Flexible business rules

## Next Implementation Steps

### ðŸš§ Phase 1: Core Storage & API (In Progress)
- [ ] Extend storage service with team CRUD methods
- [ ] Create API endpoints for team management
- [ ] Implement constraint validation engine
- [ ] Add sample team templates

### ðŸ“‹ Phase 2: Admin UI Components  
- [ ] Team Event Template Manager
- [ ] Team Formation Wizard
- [ ] Constraint Configuration Interface
- [ ] Team Roster Management
- [ ] Real-time validation feedback

### ðŸŽ¯ Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] Auto-assignment suggestions
- [ ] Bulk team operations
- [ ] Exception handling workflow
- [ ] Analytics and reporting

## Key User Journeys

### Admin Creates Team Event Template
1. Define basic template (name, category, player counts)
2. Configure constraints using drag-and-drop interface
3. Set validation rules and error messages
4. Test template with sample data
5. Save for reuse across tournaments

### Admin Manages Tournament Teams
1. Select tournament and team template
2. Monitor team formation progress
3. Handle constraint violations
4. Process player substitutions
5. Approve/modify team rosters

### Constraint Validation Flow
1. Real-time validation during team formation
2. Clear error messages for violations
3. Exception approval workflow
4. Audit trail for all changes

## Technical Architecture

### Flexible Constraint Engine
```typescript
interface TeamConstraint {
  type: ConstraintType;
  parameters: Record<string, any>;
  errorMessage: string;
  priority: number;
}
```

### Validation Pipeline
1. Template constraint loading
2. Player eligibility checking  
3. Team composition validation
4. Cross-team conflict detection
5. Exception handling

## Sample Configurations

### Traditional Doubles Template
- Min/Max: 2 players
- Constraints: no_repeat_players, skill_level_range
- Use case: Standard tournament doubles

### Corporate Challenge Template  
- Min/Max: 6-8 players
- Constraints: no_repeat_players, organization_limit
- Use case: Company team building events

### Mixed Doubles Template
- Min/Max: 2 players + 2 substitutes
- Constraints: gender_requirement (1M, 1F), skill_level_range
- Use case: Gender-balanced competitive play

## Data Integrity Considerations

- All team data sourced from authenticated user database
- Constraint validation against real player profiles
- Tournament registration verification
- Audit trail for all team modifications

## Files Modified/Created

### Schema Files
- `shared/schema/team-events.ts` - Complete team event data model
- Database tables created with proper relations

### Storage Extensions (Planned)
- `server/storage.ts` - Add team CRUD methods
- Team validation service
- Constraint engine implementation

### API Endpoints (Planned)
- `/api/team-templates` - Template management
- `/api/teams` - Team CRUD operations  
- `/api/team-members` - Player assignment
- `/api/team-constraints` - Validation rules

### UI Components (Planned)
- `TeamEventTemplateManager.tsx`
- `TeamFormationWizard.tsx` 
- `ConstraintConfigurationPanel.tsx`
- `TeamRosterManager.tsx`

## Success Metrics

- Support for 4+ different team formats
- <500ms constraint validation response time
- Zero data integrity violations
- 90%+ admin user satisfaction with flexibility

## Risk Mitigation

- Comprehensive constraint testing with edge cases
- Gradual rollout starting with simple formats
- Fallback to manual override for complex scenarios
- Real-time validation to prevent invalid states

**Next Action**: Extend storage service with team management methods and create API endpoints for the admin interface.
