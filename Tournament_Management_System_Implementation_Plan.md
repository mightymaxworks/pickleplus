## Module Architecture & Framework Principles

### Module Structure
The Tournament Management System will be implemented as a core module within our existing modular architecture, following Framework 5.3 principles:

```
/src/core/modules/tournament/
├── components/             # UI components for tournaments
│   ├── admin/             # Admin-specific components
│   ├── player/            # Player-facing components
│   ├── bracket/           # Bracket visualization components
│   └── team/              # Team tournament components
├── hooks/                 # Custom React hooks for tournament functionality
├── context/               # React context providers for tournament state
├── services/              # Tournament business logic services
├── api/                   # API integration for tournament data
├── utils/                 # Tournament-specific utility functions
├── types/                 # TypeScript types and interfaces
└── index.ts              # Module entry point and public API
```

### Module Integration
- **Explicit Dependencies**: Clearly define dependencies on other modules (e.g., ranking, user, match)
- **Clean Interfaces**: Create well-defined interfaces between modules using shared types
- **Event-Based Communication**: Use event system for cross-module notifications
- **Isolation**: Ensure the tournament module can function independently for testing
- **Shared Services**: Leverage existing application services where appropriate

### Framework Alignment
1. **Component-Based Architecture**: Follow existing component patterns for consistency
2. **State Management**: Use React Query for server state and Context for module state
3. **Type Safety**: Implement comprehensive TypeScript typing throughout
4. **API Integration**: Follow established API patterns for data fetching and mutation
5. **Performance Patterns**: Implement Framework 5.3 performance best practices

### Service Integration Points
- **Ranking System**: Tournament results feed into ranking point calculations
- **User System**: Player profiles and eligibility requirements
- **Match System**: Tournament matches leverage existing match recording
- **Notification System**: Tournament status updates utilize notification infrastructure
- **Payment System**: Tournament registration fees use existing payment processing

## Technical Considerations

### Data Modeling
- Flexible tournament structure to accommodate various formats
- Efficient bracket representation for different tournament types
- Relationship between tournaments, matches, players, and teams
- Schema design that supports the modular architecture pattern

### Performance
- Optimization for concurrent bracket updates during active tournaments
- Efficient queries for tournament listings with eligibility filtering
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed tournament data
- Module-specific performance optimizations

### Scalability
- Design to handle hundreds of concurrent tournaments
- Support for tournaments with large participant counts (100+ players)
- Architecture allowing for future expansion to new tournament types
- Independent scaling of tournament subsystems as needed

## Success Metrics
1. Tournament creation time under 10 minutes for administrators
2. Player registration completion rate above 90%
3. Tournament result reporting accuracy of 99%+
4. User satisfaction rating of 4+ out of 5 for tournament experience
5. System performance maintaining sub-2 second response times under load

## Future Enhancements (Post MVP)
1. Mobile app notifications for tournament updates
2. Live streaming integration for featured matches
3. Spectator view for following tournament progress
4. Tournament director certification program
5. Automated tournament scheduling optimization
