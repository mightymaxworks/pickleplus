  - City Level: 1.8x base points
  - Provincial Level: 2.0x base points
  - National Level: 2.5x base points
  - Regional Level: 3.0x base points
  - International Level: 4.0x base points
- Round advancement point awards:
  - Players earn points based on the furthest round they reach
  - Point structure increases with deeper tournament advancement
  - Elimination round points: R64 (10pts), R32 (15pts), R16 (25pts), QF (40pts), SF (60pts), F (80pts), Champion (100pts)
  - All base points are then multiplied by the tournament tier multiplier
- Special handling for round robin format:
  - Hybrid point allocation approach
  - 3 base points awarded per match win 
  - Placement bonuses: 10% bonus for 1st place, 5% bonus for 2nd place
  - All points then multiplied by tournament tier multiplier
  - Points only awarded after completion of all round robin matches
- Team tournament point distribution to individual player rankings:
  - Equal Distribution: All team members receive equal points regardless of participation
  - Points awarded based on the round where the team is eliminated
  - All team members receive full points based on team performance
  - All points still subject to tournament tier multipliers
- Point decay system:
  - Tournament points decay over time to keep rankings current
  - Points retain 100% value for 3 months
  - After 3 months, points decay by 15% per quarter (85% at 6 months, 70% at 9 months, 55% at 12 months)
  - After 15 months, points are removed from ranking calculation
  - This encourages continued tournament participation

## Module Architecture & Framework Principles

### Module Structure
The Tournament Management System will be implemented as a core module within our existing modular architecture, following Framework 5.3 principles:

```

│   ├── admin/             # Admin-specific components
│   ├── player/            # Player-facing components
│   ├── bracket/           # Bracket visualization components
│   └── team/              # Team tournament components
├── hooks/                 # Custom React hooks for tournament functionality
├── context/               # React context providers for tournament state
├── services/              # Tournament business logic services
├── api/                   # API integration for tournament data
├── utils/                 # Tournament-specific utility functions
├── types/                 # TypeScript types and interfaces
└── index.ts              # Module entry point and public API
```

### Module Integration
- **Explicit Dependencies**: Clearly define dependencies on other modules (e.g., ranking, user, match)
- **Clean Interfaces**: Create well-defined interfaces between modules using shared types
- **Event-Based Communication**: Use event system for cross-module notifications
- **Isolation**: Ensure the tournament module can function independently for testing
- **Shared Services**: Leverage existing application services where appropriate

### Framework Alignment
1. **Component-Based Architecture**: Follow existing component patterns for consistency
2. **State Management**: Use React Query for server state and Context for module state
3. **Type Safety**: Implement comprehensive TypeScript typing throughout
4. **API Integration**: Follow established API patterns for data fetching and mutation
5. **Performance Patterns**: Implement Framework 5.3 performance best practices

### Service Integration Points
- **Ranking System**: Tournament results feed into ranking point calculations
- **User System**: Player profiles and eligibility requirements
- **Match System**: Tournament matches leverage existing match recording
- **Notification System**: Tournament status updates utilize notification infrastructure
- **Payment System**: Tournament registration fees use existing payment processing

## Technical Considerations

### Data Modeling
- Flexible tournament structure to accommodate various formats
- Efficient bracket representation for different tournament types
- Relationship between tournaments, matches, players, and teams
- Schema design that supports the modular architecture pattern

### Performance
- Optimization for concurrent bracket updates during active tournaments
- Efficient queries for tournament listings with eligibility filtering
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed tournament data
- Module-specific performance optimizations

### Scalability
- Design to handle hundreds of concurrent tournaments
- Support for tournaments with large participant counts (100+ players)
- Architecture allowing for future expansion to new tournament types
- Independent scaling of tournament subsystems as needed

## Tournament Seeding Implementation

### Ranking Points-Based Seeding System
The tournament module will implement a sophisticated seeding system based primarily on player ranking points, with the following key features:

#### Single Elimination Tournament Seeding
- Seed #1 placed at the top of the bracket
- Seed #2 placed at the bottom of the bracket
- Seeds #3 and #4 placed at quarter-final positions opposite of their closest higher seed
- Remaining seeds distributed to prevent top seeds from meeting early
- Implementation of "separation of conflict" to keep players from same club/region separated when possible
- Support for tournament director manual seed adjustments

#### Double Elimination Tournament Seeding
- Initial seeding follows single elimination pattern
- Loser's bracket seeding structured to prevent early rematches
- Proper bracket positioning to ensure balanced bracket integrity
- Winner's bracket finalists properly placed in loser's bracket final rounds

#### Round Robin Group Seeding
- Snake seeding across groups (1→A, 2→B, 3→C, 4→C, 5→B, 6→A, etc.)
- One top seed per group when possible
- Balanced distribution of skill levels across groups
- Option for manual group assignments by tournament director

#### Team Tournament Seeding
- Primary: Combined ranking points of all team members
- Alternative options:
  - Average of top X players
  - Weighted average based on lineup requirements
  - Previous tournament results
- Special handling for teams with balanced gender/age requirements
- Team composition validation against tournament requirements

#### Qualifying Round Integration
- Proper placement of qualifiers in main draw
- Options for directing qualifiers to face seeded players
- Protected seeding for main draw players
- Balanced qualifier distribution throughout the bracket

#### Customizable Seeding Parameters
- Tournament tier multipliers for ranking points
- Age division adjustment factors
- Format-specific seeding rules
- Recent performance weighting

### Seeding Algorithm Technical Implementation
The seeding implementation will use a modular approach:
1. Core seeding logic based on player/team ranking data
2. Format-specific placement algorithms (separate implementations per format)
3. Extensible design to allow for future seeding strategies
4. Visualization hooks to display seeding in brackets

## Success Metrics
1. Tournament creation time under 10 minutes for administrators
2. Player registration completion rate above 90%
3. Tournament result reporting accuracy of 99%+
4. User satisfaction rating of 4+ out of 5 for tournament experience
5. System performance maintaining sub-2 second response times under load

## Future Enhancements (Post MVP)
1. Mobile app notifications for tournament updates
2. Live streaming integration for featured matches
3. Spectator view for following tournament progress
4. Tournament director certification program
5. Automated tournament scheduling optimization
