## INTEGRATION POINTS & DATA FLOW

### Integration Point 1: Player â†’ Coach Connection
```
Player Profile â†’ Coach Discovery â†’ Session Booking â†’ Coach Management
```

**Data Flow:**
1. Player views their passport dashboard with skill levels and PCP ratings
2. Player clicks "Find Coaches" to discover coaches by specialty
3. System matches player needs with coach specialties (e.g., "Mental Game" coaches for low mental scores)
4. Player books session through `/api/sessions/request` endpoint
5. Coach receives booking in their coach management dashboard

**Database Relationships:**
- `users.id` â†’ `coach_profiles.userId` (coach identity)
- Player session requests link `coach_profiles.id` â†’ session booking system
- Coach specialties array matches player PCP assessment gaps

### Integration Point 2: Coach â†’ Facility Assignment
```
Coach Profile â†’ Facility Access â†’ Class Management â†’ Player Enrollment
```

**Data Flow:**
1. Coach completes PCP Coaching Certification Programme application
2. Coach gains access to training facilities through QR codes or facility selection
3. Coach is assigned to specific classes at facilities
4. Players discover and enroll in coach-led classes through facility booking system

**Database Relationships:**
- `coach_profiles.id` â†’ facility class assignments
- Facility QR codes â†’ coach access permissions
- Class enrollment links players â†’ coaches â†’ facilities

### Integration Point 3: Facility â†’ Player Development
```
Facility Access â†’ Coach Selection â†’ Skill Assessment â†’ Progress Tracking
```

**Data Flow:**
1. Player scans facility QR code (e.g., "TC001-SG") to access training center
2. System presents available coaches at that facility
3. Player selects coach based on specialties matching their PCP assessment needs
4. Training sessions update player's PCP scores and progression
5. Facility tracks player development and coach effectiveness

**Database Relationships:**
- Facility check-ins update player activity history
- Coach-player interactions at facilities affect PCP ratings
- Training session completion triggers skill progression updates

### ðŸ”§ INTEGRATION OPPORTUNITIES:

#### Smart Coach Recommendations
```javascript
// Example: Match player PCP gaps with coach specialties
const playerPCPData = {
  technical: 85,
  tactical: 60,   // Gap identified
  physical: 75,
  mental: 55      // Gap identified
};

const recommendedCoaches = coaches.filter(coach => 
  coach.specialties.includes('Tactical Skills') || 
  coach.specialties.includes('Mental Game')
);
```

#### Facility-Based Coach Discovery
```javascript
// Example: Show coaches available at player's preferred facility
const facilityCoaches = await apiRequest('GET', `/api/facilities/${facilityId}/coaches`);
```

#### Integrated Progress Tracking
```javascript
// Example: Update PCP scores after facility training sessions
const sessionComplete = {
  playerId: player.id,
  coachId: coach.id,
  facilityId: facility.id,
  skillsWorked: ['tactical', 'mental'],
  improvements: { tactical: +2, mental: +3 }
};
```
