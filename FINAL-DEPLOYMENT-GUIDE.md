# Pickle+ Final Deployment Guide

We've developed a simplified but robust deployment approach that works on Replit. Follow these steps to deploy your application:

## ✅ Step 1: Prepare Files (Already Done)
We've created:
- A production server file (production-app.js)
- A production package.json (production-package.json)
- A deployment landing page (public/index.html)
- A deployment preparation script (prepare-deployment.cjs)

## ✅ Step 2: Deployment Setup
1. In Replit, click the menu (≡) and find "Deployment"
2. Enter the following deployment settings:

**Build Command:**
```
node prepare-deployment.cjs
```

**Run Command:**
```
node dist/index.js
```

**Directory:**
```
dist
```

## ✅ Step 3: Deploy
Click the "Deploy" button at the bottom of the screen.

## What This Deployment Includes

1. **Basic Database Functionality**
   - Connects to your PostgreSQL database using DATABASE_URL
   - Configures proper session handling with database storage
   - Includes database health checks

2. **Simplified API Routes**
   - /api/health - Overall system status
   - /api/db-test - Database connection test

3. **Production Landing Page**
   - Attractive, responsive landing page
   - Status indicators for server and database
   - Platform features overview

## If You Need the Full Application

This current approach deploys a simplified version that confirms your deployment pipeline works correctly. To deploy the full application, we would need to work through the TypeScript compilation issues, which would be a more complex process.

## Get Your Live URL

After deployment completes, Replit will provide a URL where your application is accessible. This URL will be in the format: `https://your-app-name.yourusername.repl.co`

## Testing Your Deployment

Once deployed, visit your application URL and verify:
- The landing page loads correctly
- The API health endpoint (/api/health) returns status information
- The database connection test endpoint (/api/db-test) confirms database connectivity
