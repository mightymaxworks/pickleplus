# Pickle+ Deployment Guide (Final Version)

This guide provides the final recommended deployment approach for the Pickle+ platform.

## Deployment Options

We've created multiple deployment options to fit your needs, each with different levels of functionality:

### Option 1: Simple Landing Page (Most Reliable)
This is the most reliable option and is guaranteed to work without errors. It serves a beautiful landing page without requiring database or WebSocket connections.

**Files needed:**
- `landing-deploy.js` - The server file
- `landing-package.json` - The package.json file

**Deployment steps:**
1. On the Replit deployment page:
   - Set Build Command to: `cp landing-deploy.js index.js && cp landing-package.json package.json && npm install`
   - Set Run Command to: `npm start`
   - Click Deploy

### Option 2: Full Frontend Build (Most Complete)
This option builds and serves the complete React frontend, but may take longer to deploy due to the build process.

**Files needed:**
- `deploy-frontend.sh` - Deployment script
- `frontend-deploy.js` - Server file
- `frontend-package.json` - Package.json file

**Deployment steps:**
1. On the Replit deployment page:
   - Set Build Command to: `bash deploy-frontend.sh`
   - Set Run Command to: `npm start`
   - Click Deploy

### Option 3: Simple Proxy (Easy Frontend)
This option serves a nice landing page with a link to redirect to your application without trying to build the entire frontend.

**Files needed:**
- `simple-frontend-deploy.js` - The server file that proxies to the app
- Create a simple package.json:
  ```json
  {
    "name": "pickle-plus",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "main": "simple-frontend-deploy.js",
    "scripts": {
      "start": "node simple-frontend-deploy.js"
    },
    "dependencies": {
      "express": "^4.18.3"
    }
  }
  ```

**Deployment steps:**
1. On the Replit deployment page:
   - Set Build Command to: `cp simple-frontend-deploy.js index.js && echo '{"name":"pickle-plus","version":"1.0.0","main":"index.js","scripts":{"start":"node index.js"},"dependencies":{"express":"^4.18.3"}}' > package.json && npm install`
   - Set Run Command to: `npm start`
   - Click Deploy

## Important Notes

1. **Port Configuration**: All deployment options are configured to use port 8080, which is required by the Cloud Run service.

2. **Database Connection**: If you need database functionality, you will need to add database configuration to your deployment option.

3. **WebSocket Issues**: Full deployments with WebSocket connections have been problematic. The simplified options avoid these issues.

4. **Express Static Files**: All options include proper serving of static files for the frontend.

5. **Health Endpoints**: All options include a `/api/health` endpoint for monitoring.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with your deployment:

1. Check the deployment logs for error messages
2. Try a simpler deployment option
3. Verify that your environment variables are correctly set
4. For database issues, verify that the DATABASE_URL environment variable is set
