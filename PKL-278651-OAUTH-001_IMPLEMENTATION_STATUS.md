# External Authentication API Implementation Status

**PKL-278651-OAUTH-001**  
**Last Updated:** May 1, 2025  
**Status:** In Progress

## 1. Overview

This document details the implementation status of the External Authentication API for Pickle+. This system allows third-party applications to authenticate users through Pickle+ using the OAuth 2.0 protocol, similar to "Sign in with Google" functionality.

## 2. Completed Components

### 2.1 Database Schema
- ✅ Created OAuth database schema in `shared/schema/oauth.ts`
- ✅ Defined tables for OAuth clients, tokens, authorization codes, and user consents
- ✅ Created Zod validation schemas for data validation
- ✅ Defined scope system for granular permission control

### 2.2 Database Migration
- ✅ Created migration script for initializing OAuth tables in `migrations/0001_create_oauth_tables.ts`
- ✅ Added proper indexes for performance optimization
- ✅ Ensured proper foreign key relationships with existing user table

### 2.3 Service Layer
- ✅ Implemented `OAuthClientService` for managing application registrations
- ✅ Created `TokenService` for issuing and validating JWT tokens
- ✅ Built `AuthorizationCodeService` for handling authorization codes
- ✅ Developed `AuthorizationService` for user consent management

### 2.4 Controller Layer
- ✅ Created controllers for handling OAuth endpoints
- ✅ Implemented authorization endpoint for initiating the OAuth flow
- ✅ Built token endpoint for exchanging authorization codes for tokens
- ✅ Added userinfo endpoint for retrieving user profile data
- ✅ Included token revocation endpoint

## 3. Pending Components

### 3.1 Routes and Middleware
- ⏳ Create route file to connect controllers to HTTP endpoints
- ⏳ Implement CORS support for cross-origin requests
- ⏳ Add rate limiting to protect against abuse
- ⏳ Create middleware for OAuth-specific validations

### 3.2 Developer Portal
- ⏳ Create UI for developers to register applications
- ⏳ Build application management dashboard
- ⏳ Implement application approval workflow for administrators
- ⏳ Add developer documentation section

### 3.3 Consent Screens
- ⏳ Design and implement user consent UI
- ⏳ Create templates for consent screens
- ⏳ Add functionality for users to manage connected applications

### 3.4 Documentation
- ⏳ Create integration guide for third-party developers
- ⏳ Document available scopes and endpoints
- ⏳ Provide sample code for common integration scenarios

## 4. Implementation Notes

### 4.1 Architecture
- The OAuth system is implemented as a separate module that does not modify existing application code
- It shares the user database but has its own tables for OAuth-specific data
- The system uses JWT tokens with proper signature verification

### 4.2 Security Considerations
- Implements PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) for added security
- Uses secure token generation via cryptographically secure random bytes
- Stores hashed client secrets using bcrypt
- Sets appropriate token expiration times

### 4.3 OAuth Flows
- Authorization Code flow (for web applications)
- Refresh Token flow (for extending sessions)
- Token Revocation (for ending sessions)

## 5. Next Steps

1. Create the routes file to connect the controllers to HTTP endpoints
2. Build the developer portal UI components
3. Create consent screen templates
4. Add documentation for third-party developers
5. Implement testing suite for OAuth flows
