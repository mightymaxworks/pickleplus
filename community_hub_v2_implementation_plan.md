# Community Hub V2 Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for an alternative Community Hub using open source integration as the primary approach. This implementation will be deployed at `/community/v2` for A/B testing against the current custom-built solution.

## Architecture

The Community Hub V2 will use a hybrid approach:
- NodeBB as the core community engine (discussions, profiles, notifications)
- Custom UI wrapper for consistent Pickle+ branding and navigation
- API gateway for data synchronization between systems

## Sprint Structure

### PKL-278651-COMM-0011-OSI: Community Open Source Evaluation and Setup

**Description**: Evaluate and set up the core open source community platform (NodeBB) with initial configuration and branding.

**Tasks**:
1. Set up NodeBB instance and configure database connection
2. Create initial admin accounts and permission structure
3. Apply Pickle+ branding elements (colors, logos)
4. Configure basic community categories for pickleball discussions

**Prompt for Development**:
```
Implement the NodeBB community platform integration for Pickle+. Set up the core instance with PostgreSQL database connection, implement initial user roles (Admin, Moderator, Community Leader, Member), and apply the Pickle+ branding guidelines (primary color: #3B7A57, secondary: #F8F9FA). Create dedicated categories for "Technique Discussion", "Equipment", "Local Courts", "Tournaments", and "General Discussion". Configure the API key for external integration.
```

### PKL-278651-COMM-0012-API: Authentication and API Integration

**Description**: Implement authentication bridge between Pickle+ and the community platform, and create API gateway for data exchange.

**Tasks**:
1. Create SSO integration between Pickle+ and NodeBB
2. Implement user profile synchronization
3. Develop API gateway for bi-directional data flow
4. Set up webhooks for real-time updates

**Prompt for Development**:
```
Create an authentication bridge between the Pickle+ platform and NodeBB. Implement OAuth2 flow for single sign-on, ensuring users maintain a single identity across both systems. Develop an API gateway that synchronizes user profiles, membership status, and activity metrics. Set up webhook listeners for real-time notifications when community events occur. Follow the Framework 5.2 guidelines for API Gateway implementation with proper error handling and logging.
```

### PKL-278651-COMM-0013-SDK: Community API Client and Hooks

**Description**: Create SDK layer components to interact with the community platform.

**Tasks**:
1. Implement hooks for fetching community data
2. Create mutations for posting, liking, and commenting
3. Develop hooks for event management
4. Build notification and activity feed hooks

**Prompt for Development**:
```
Following Framework 5.2 SDK layer principles, create a comprehensive set of React hooks for interacting with the NodeBB community API. Implement `useCommunityDiscussions`, `useCommunityPost`, `useCreatePost`, `useLikePost`, `useCommentOnPost`, `useCommunityNotifications`, and `useCommunityEvents` hooks. Each hook should handle loading states, error handling, and data caching using TanStack Query. Ensure proper TypeScript typing for all API responses. Include integration with the authentication context to handle API permissions.
```

### PKL-278651-COMM-0014-UI: Community Integration UI Layer

**Description**: Build UI components that integrate the NodeBB functionality with the Pickle+ design system.

**Tasks**:
1. Create community navigation shell
2. Implement discussion list and detail views
3. Build post editor with Pickle+ theming
4. Develop unified notification component

**Prompt for Development**:
```
Create UI components that integrate NodeBB community functionality with the Pickle+ design system. Implement a responsive layout following mobile-first principles. Components should include CommunityNavigation, DiscussionList, DiscussionDetail, PostEditor, CommentList, and NotificationPanel. Use Tailwind CSS for styling with the Pickle+ color scheme. Ensure accessibility compliance with proper ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation. Add the pickleball-specific iconography and terminology throughout the interface. Each component should include proper Framework 5.2 annotations.
```

### PKL-278651-COMM-0015-ADAPT: Pickleball-Specific Community Extensions

**Description**: Extend the community platform with Pickle+ specific features.

**Tasks**:
1. Create custom fields for pickleball skill level and preferences
2. Implement rating display integration
3. Develop match result sharing templates
4. Build tournament discussion integration

**Prompt for Development**:
```
Extend the NodeBB community platform with pickleball-specific features following Framework 5.2 OSI patterns. Create custom user profile fields for skill level (using CourtIQâ„¢ Rating), preferred play style, and equipment details. Implement a Rating Badge component that displays a user's current rating alongside their posts. Develop specialized templates for sharing match results in community discussions. Create a Tournament Discussion integration that automatically creates discussion threads for upcoming tournaments and links them to the tournament detail pages. All extensions should maintain consistent Pickle+ branding and terminology.
```

### PKL-278651-COMM-0016-TEST: Integration Testing and Performance Optimization

**Description**: Thoroughly test the integrated solution and optimize for performance.

**Tasks**:
1. Implement end-to-end tests for community workflows
2. Perform load testing with simulated users
3. Optimize API caching and request patterns
4. Implement performance monitoring

**Prompt for Development**:
```
Create a comprehensive test suite for the integrated community platform following Framework 5.2 testing guidelines. Implement end-to-end tests using Cypress that verify key user journeys: registering, creating posts, commenting, liking, navigating between discussions, and receiving notifications. Perform load testing with k6 to simulate 1,000 concurrent users, measuring response times and resource utilization. Implement performance optimizations including API response caching, lazy-loading of content, virtualized lists for long discussion threads, and image optimization. Add Prometheus metrics for real-time performance monitoring. Document all test results and optimizations applied.
```

### PKL-278651-COMM-0017-AB: A/B Testing Implementation

**Description**: Set up infrastructure for comparing the new community implementation against the original.

**Tasks**:
1. Implement routing for the new community at `/community/v2`
2. Create analytics tracking for both community versions
3. Define success metrics and tracking
4. Build admin dashboard for comparing metrics

**Prompt for Development**:
```
Implement A/B testing infrastructure for comparing the original community implementation with the NodeBB-integrated version. Create a routing system that allows users to access both versions, with the new implementation at `/community/v2`. Implement analytics tracking that measures key metrics: user engagement (time spent, posts created, likes given), feature usage (which components are used most), performance metrics (load time, interaction delays), and conversion metrics (event signups, match recordings). Create an admin dashboard that visualizes these metrics side-by-side with statistical significance indicators. Allow for cohort analysis to compare adoption between different user segments. Document the testing methodology and success criteria.
```

## Technical Stack

- **Core Platform**: NodeBB (Node.js, MongoDB/PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication**: OAuth2, JWT tokens
- **API Gateway**: Express.js middleware with rate limiting and caching
- **Frontend Integration**: React components with Tailwind CSS
- **Testing**: Cypress (E2E), k6 (load testing), Jest (unit tests)
- **Analytics**: Custom event tracking with Prometheus/Grafana

## Route Structure

The new community hub will be available at the following routes:

- `/community/v2` - Main community landing page
- `/community/v2/discussions/:categoryId` - Category discussions  
- `/community/v2/discussion/:id` - Individual discussion thread
- `/community/v2/profile/:username` - User profile
- `/community/v2/events` - Community events
- `/community/v2/notifications` - User notifications

## Data Migration Strategy

For the A/B test, we'll implement bi-directional synchronization:

1. User accounts and profiles sync between systems
2. New content created in either system is synced to the other
3. Activity (likes, comments) is mirrored between implementations
4. A unified notification system alerts users on both platforms

## Success Metrics

The A/B test will measure:

1. **Engagement**: Time spent, posts created, return frequency
2. **Performance**: Page load times, interaction responsiveness
3. **User Satisfaction**: Feedback surveys, feature usage
4. **Technical Metrics**: Server load, API response times
5. **Business Impact**: Tournament registrations, match recordings, new user retention
