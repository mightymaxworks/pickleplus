# Community Hub v2 Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for the Community Hub v2, a complete redesign of the Pickle+ community features using a modular, open-source approach with NodeBB integration. This implementation aligns with our Framework v5.2's open-source-first philosophy.

## Objectives

1. Rebuild community features using NodeBB as the foundation
2. Maintain full integration with Pickle+ user accounts and features
3. Provide enhanced community management tools
4. Reduce development time through leveraging existing open-source solutions
5. Facilitate A/B testing against current implementation

## Technical Architecture

The implementation uses a multi-tiered approach:

1. **NodeBB Core**: Provides the forum functionality, user management, and content storage
2. **Integration Layer**: Connects NodeBB with Pickle+ authentication and data
3. **UI Layer**: Custom React components that maintain Pickle+ design language
4. **Extension Layer**: Custom NodeBB plugins for pickleball-specific features

## Implementation Sprints

### Sprint 1: PKL-278651-COMM-0011-OSI - Community Open Source Evaluation and Setup

- Create proof of concept integration

### Sprint 2: PKL-278651-COMM-0012-API - Authentication and API Integration
**Duration**: 1 week
**Objective**: Enable seamless authentication between Pickle+ and NodeBB
**Tasks**:
- Implement OAuth2 provider in Pickle+ backend
- Configure NodeBB to use Pickle+ OAuth2 for authentication
- Create user profile sync mechanism
- Build API gateway for proxying NodeBB requests
- Implement webhook handler for receiving NodeBB events

### Sprint 3: PKL-278651-COMM-0013-SDK - Community API Client and Hooks
**Duration**: 1 week
**Objective**: Create reusable SDK for interacting with Community Hub
**Tasks**:
- Build React hooks for community data (useCommunity, useThread, usePost)
- Create TypeScript interfaces for NodeBB data models
- Implement client-side caching strategy
- Build translation layer for mapping between systems
- Create utilities for common community operations

### Sprint 4: PKL-278651-COMM-0014-UI - Community Integration UI Layer
**Duration**: 2 weeks
**Objective**: Create React components that embed NodeBB within Pickle+ UI
**Tasks**:
- Create Community Hub main page layout
- Build thread listing component
- Implement thread detail and reply components
- Create user profile integration components
- Build community management UI components
- Implement notification components
- Create responsive mobile views

### Sprint 5: PKL-278651-COMM-0015-ADAPT - Pickleball-Specific Community Extensions
**Duration**: 2 weeks
**Objective**: Extend NodeBB with pickleball-specific functionality
**Tasks**:
- Create NodeBB plugin for displaying skill ratings
- Implement match result sharing templates
- Build skill level filtering functionality
- Create community event integration
- Implement achievement and progression display
- Build leaderboard integration

### Sprint 6: PKL-278651-COMM-0016-TEST - Integration Testing and Performance Optimization
**Duration**: 1 week
**Objective**: Ensure system reliability and performance
**Tasks**:
- Create end-to-end tests for community features
- Implement load testing for concurrent users
- Optimize performance for mobile devices
- Create monitoring dashboard for community metrics
- Document testing results and optimizations

### Sprint 7: PKL-278651-COMM-0017-AB - A/B Testing Implementation
**Duration**: 1 week
**Objective**: Enable comparative testing between old and new community implementations
**Tasks**:
- Implement feature flag system for A/B testing
- Create analytics tracking for both implementations
- Build comparison dashboard for metrics
- Develop migration path for community data
- Create rollback plan if issues arise

## Technical Details

### Database Structure

NodeBB will use its own tables within our PostgreSQL database:

- **categories**: Community groups/forums
- **topics**: Discussion threads
- **posts**: Individual messages
- **users**: User profiles (synced with Pickle+)
- **groups**: User permissions groups

### Integration Points

1. **Authentication**: OAuth2 between systems
2. **User Profiles**: Bi-directional sync of user data
3. **Notifications**: NodeBB events published to Pickle+
4. **Activity Feed**: Community activity included in user dashboard
5. **Search**: Unified search across both systems

### Hosting Configuration

NodeBB will be hosted alongside our existing application:

1. **Development**: Run as separate process on same host
2. **Production**: Deploy as separate service with API gateway

## UI/UX Design Principles

1. Maintain consistent design language with Pickle+
2. Create a seamless experience between systems
3. Optimize for mobile-first navigation
4. Provide clear visual indicators for community features
5. Implement progressive enhancement for optional features

## Success Metrics

The implementation will be considered successful if:

1. User engagement increases (posts, replies, time spent)
2. Community creation and growth metrics improve
3. Development velocity increases for new community features
4. Bug reports decrease compared to current implementation
5. Performance metrics meet or exceed targets (load time, responsiveness)

## Resources Required

- Frontend developer with React experience
- Backend developer with OAuth2 knowledge
- Designer for community UI components
- QA engineer for integration testing
- DevOps support for deployment configuration

## Timeline

Total estimated duration: **9 weeks**

| Sprint | Duration | Dependencies |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| OSI Setup | 1 week | None |
| API Integration | 1 week | OSI Setup |
| SDK Development | 1 week | API Integration |
| UI Layer | 2 weeks | SDK Development |
| Extensions | 2 weeks | UI Layer |
| Testing | 1 week | Extensions |
| A/B Testing | 1 week | Testing |

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| OAuth integration issues | High | Medium | Create fallback authentication mechanism |
| Performance degradation | High | Low | Implement caching and CDN for static content |
| Data synchronization errors | Medium | Medium | Create reconciliation process and validation |
| Mobile responsiveness issues | Medium | Low | Prioritize mobile testing throughout development |
| User adoption resistance | Medium | Medium | Provide easy access to both versions during transition |

## Next Steps

1. Complete the Proof of Concept (POC) to validate approach
2. Assemble implementation team
3. Begin Sprint 1 (OSI Setup)
4. Create detailed technical specifications for each sprint
