## Rating Calculation Algorithm

### Weighted Scoring System
```javascript
function calculateOverallPCPRating(assessment) {
    const technicalWeight = 0.40;
    const tacticalWeight = 0.25;
    const physicalWeight = 0.20;
    const mentalWeight = 0.15;
    
    const technicalScore = calculateTechnicalRating(assessment);
    const tacticalScore = calculateTacticalRating(assessment);
    const physicalScore = calculatePhysicalRating(assessment);
    const mentalScore = calculateMentalRating(assessment);
    
    const overallRating = (
        technicalScore * technicalWeight +
        tacticalScore * tacticalWeight +
        physicalScore * physicalWeight +
        mentalScore * mentalWeight
    );
    
    return Math.round(overallRating * 100) / 100;
}
```
