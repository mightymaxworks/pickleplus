# Pickle+ Load Testing Framework
**PKL-278651-PERF-0001-LOAD**

This directory contains the load testing infrastructure for the Pickle+ platform, designed to verify performance under expected launch traffic and identify potential bottlenecks before the April 13th launch.

## Test Scenarios

### Authentication Load Testing
- Concurrent user login requests
- Session management under load
- Registration process performance

### Tournament Discovery Testing
- High-volume tournament browsing
- Filter application performance
- Tournament detail page loading

### Match Recording & Validation
- Concurrent match submissions
- Validation request processing
- Statistics calculation performance

### Golden Ticket Testing
- Concurrent ticket claim processing
- Sponsor reveal performance
- Database locking behavior

### Leaderboard & Ranking Tests
- Leaderboard calculation under load
- Ranking update performance
- Multi-dimensional ranking queries

## Running the Tests

Tests can be executed using k6 or another HTTP load testing tool. The testing infrastructure is designed to be run in stages:

1. **Baseline Tests**: Establish current performance metrics
2. **Capacity Tests**: Determine maximum throughput
3. **Stress Tests**: Identify breaking points
4. **Endurance Tests**: Verify stability over time

## Performance Thresholds

Key performance thresholds have been established:

- API response time: 95% under 500ms at 3x projected load
- Error rate: Under 0.1% for all endpoints
- CPU utilization: Under 70% sustained
- Memory utilization: Under 80% sustained
- Database query execution: 99% under 100ms

## Implementation Notes

- Tests are designed to be non-destructive to production data
- Each test focuses on a specific user journey
- Proper cleanup occurs after test execution
- All tests adhere to Framework 5.0 standards

## Reporting

Test results are collected and reported in:
- Real-time performance dashboard
- Detailed CSV performance logs
- Summary reports with actionable insights
- Trend analysis for regression detection

This load testing framework is a critical component of the launch readiness assessment for the Pickle+ platform.
