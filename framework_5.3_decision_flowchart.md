# Framework 5.3: Decision Flowchart

This flowchart provides a visual decision-making guide for implementing features or fixing bugs using the simplicity principles in Framework 5.3.

```
START
  |
  v
[DEFINE THE PROBLEM]
  | Is the problem statement clear and specific?
  | NO → Clarify the problem statement
  | YES ↓
  v
[FIND THE SIMPLEST SOLUTION]
  | Does a standard browser API solve this problem?
  | YES → Use the standard browser API
  | NO ↓
  v
[EVALUATE EXISTING CODE]
  | Can the issue be fixed by simplifying existing code?
  | YES → Simplify the existing code
  | NO ↓
  v
[ASSESS SOLUTION COMPLEXITY]
  | Will the solution require more than 3 state variables?
  | YES → Can any state variables be combined or eliminated?
  |        YES → Simplify state management
  |        NO ↓
  | NO ↓
  v
[SELECT IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH]
  | Image handling? → Use FileReader for previews
  | Data persistence? → Use localStorage directly
  | Form handling? → Use library validation
  | Asynchronous operations? → Use async/await
  | UI components? → Use minimal nesting
  | ↓
  v
[IMPLEMENT MINIMAL SOLUTION]
  | Can the solution be implemented in less than 50 lines?
  | NO → Break down into smaller parts or simplify
  | YES ↓
  v
[TEST SOLUTION]
  | Does the solution work correctly?
  | NO → Debug with console logs at key points
  | YES ↓
  v
[REVIEW FOR SIMPLICITY]
  | Can a junior developer understand this?
  | NO → Refactor for clarity
  | YES ↓
  v
[FINAL CHECKS]
  | Does the solution:
  | 1. Solve the core problem directly?
  | 2. Use standard patterns where possible?
  | 3. Avoid unnecessary abstractions?
  | 4. Handle edge cases appropriately?
  | NO → Revise solution
  | YES ↓

## Common Decision Points and Simplicity Guidelines

### 1. State Management Decisions

```
Need to manage component state?
  |
  +--> Just UI state (open/closed)? --> Use useState(boolean)
  |
  +--> Form inputs? --> Use simple useState({...}) for small forms
  |                     or useForm/library for complex forms
  |
  +--> Derived from props? --> Calculate in render, avoid useState
  |
  +--> Persisted across sessions? --> Use localStorage directly
  |
  +--> Application-wide state? --> Consider useContext for sharing
```

### 2. User Interface Decisions

```
Building a UI component?
  |
  +--> Simple display component? --> Functional component with minimal props
  |
  +--> Interactive component? --> Keep all related logic in one place
  |
  +--> Complex layout? --> Break into smaller components
  |
  +--> Need to show/hide content? --> Use conditional rendering (? :)
  |                                   or early returns for clarity
  |
  +--> Lists of items? --> Flat map() with inline rendering
```

### 3. Data Fetching Decisions

```
Need to fetch data?
  |
  +--> Internal API call? --> Use simple fetch() with async/await
  |
  +--> Need caching? --> Consider localStorage for simple cases
  |
  +--> Loading states? --> Use single isLoading boolean
  |
  +--> Error handling? --> Use try/catch with user-friendly messages
```

### 4. Event Handling Decisions

```
Handling user events?
  |
  +--> Simple click/change? --> Inline handler or simple function
  |
  +--> Form submission? --> Validate then submit in single function
  |
  +--> Debounced input? --> Use simple setTimeout/clearTimeout
  |
  +--> Need to reference DOM? --> Use useRef hook directly
```

## Example: Image Preview Decision Path

```
Need image preview functionality?
  |
  +--> Is it just for display before upload? 
  |     YES --> Use FileReader with readAsDataURL
  |     NO ↓
  |
  +--> Need to manipulate the image?
  |     YES --> Use HTML Canvas
  |     NO ↓
  |
  +--> Need to track upload progress?
  |     YES --> Use XMLHttpRequest with progress event
  |     NO ↓
  |
  +--> Simple upload with preview?
  |     YES --> Use FormData with fetch API
```

Remember: Start with the simplest solution and only add complexity when you hit a specific limitation.
