# Bounce Bug List Reports

Bounce now generates comprehensive bug reports with solution prompts to help developers fix issues quickly.

## Generating Bug Reports

To generate a bug report with solution prompts, use the `buglist` output format:

```bash
# Run the setup script first to install dependencies
bash bounce/setup.sh

# Run bounce with buglist output format
npx tsx bounce/cli.ts run --suite all --output buglist
```

This will generate a markdown file in the `reports` directory containing:

1. A summary of all issues found
2. A categorized list of bugs with details:
   - Bug description
   - Severity level
   - Location in the codebase
   - Browser/environment information
   - Evidence details
3. **Solution prompts** for each bug that:
   - Explain the likely cause of the issue
   - Provide targeted debugging suggestions
   - Offer code examples for potential fixes
   - Include verification steps

## Example Output

Here's an example of a bug report with solution prompts:

## Summary

This report contains 3 issues detected during automated testing:

- Critical Issues: 1
- Moderate Issues: 1
- Low Issues: 1

## Bug List

### Bug #1: Community page shows loading spinner indefinitely

**Severity:** ðŸ”´ Critical
**Location:** Community Module (/communities)
**Browser:** Chrome on Desktop

**Evidence:**
- SCREENSHOT: Screenshot at time of issue
- CONSOLE: Error in API response: TypeError: Cannot read property 'data' of undefined

**Solution Prompt:**

Fix the following issue in the Community Module area at path /communities:

Community page shows loading spinner indefinitely

This appears to be a data loading or API issue. Check for:
- API endpoint correctness
- Data fetching logic
- Error handling for data loading
- State management during loading

The main issue appears to be a failure to handle an API response that doesn't contain the expected data structure. Look for code that's accessing properties like `response.data` without first checking if `response` is defined or has a `data` property.

The error occurs in the community data fetching logic. Consider adding proper error handling:

```jsx
// Before:
const { data } = await api.get('/api/communities');
setCommunities(data.communities);

// After:
try {
  const { data } = await api.get('/api/communities');
  setCommunities(data?.communities || []);
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Failed to fetch communities:', error);
  setError('Failed to load communities');
  setCommunities([]);
} finally {
  setLoading(false);
}
```

After fixing, verify the solution by:
1. Running focused Bounce tests on this specific area
2. Testing across multiple browsers (Chrome specifically)
3. Verifying no regression in related functionality
```

## Benefits of Solution Prompts

The solution prompts provide:

1. **Contextual analysis**: Bounce analyzes the specific issue and its context to provide targeted suggestions
2. **Code samples**: Where possible, prompts include before/after code examples to illustrate fixes
3. **Verification guidance**: Each prompt includes testing steps to verify the fix works properly
4. **Education**: Prompts explain WHY the issue is occurring, helping developers learn while fixing

## Customizing Solution Prompts

You can modify how solution prompts are generated by editing the `generateSolutionPrompt` method in `bounce/reporting/enhanced-report-generator.ts`.

This allows you to:
- Add custom templates for specific types of issues
- Incorporate project-specific guidance
- Adjust the level of detail in the prompts
- Add links to internal documentation or resources
