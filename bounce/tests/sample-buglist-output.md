## Bug List

### Bug #1: Community page shows loading spinner indefinitely

**Severity:** ðŸ”´ Critical
**Location:** Community Module (/communities)
**Browser:** Chrome on Desktop

**Evidence:**
- SCREENSHOT: Screenshot at time of issue
- CONSOLE: Error in API response: TypeError: Cannot read property 'data' of undefined

**Solution Prompt:**

Fix the following issue in the Community Module area at path /communities:

Community page shows loading spinner indefinitely

This appears to be a data loading or API issue. Check for:
- API endpoint correctness
- Data fetching logic
- Error handling for data loading
- State management during loading

The main issue appears to be a failure to handle an API response that doesn't contain the expected data structure. Look for code that's accessing properties like `response.data` without first checking if `response` is defined or has a `data` property.

The error occurs in the community data fetching logic. Consider adding proper error handling:

```jsx
// Before:
const { data } = await api.get('/api/communities');
setCommunities(data.communities);

// After:
try {
  const { data } = await api.get('/api/communities');
  setCommunities(data?.communities || []);
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Failed to fetch communities:', error);
  setError('Failed to load communities');
  setCommunities([]);
} finally {
  setLoading(false);
}
```

After fixing, verify the solution by:
1. Running focused Bounce tests on this specific area
2. Testing across multiple browsers (Chrome specifically)
3. Verifying no regression in related functionality

### Bug #2: Profile images not loading properly on community posts

**Severity:** ðŸŸ  Moderate
**Location:** Community Post Component (/communities/3)
**Browser:** Chrome on Desktop

**Evidence:**
- SCREENSHOT: Missing profile images in post list
- CONSOLE: 404 errors for profile image URLs

**Solution Prompt:**

Fix the following issue in the Community Post Component area at path /communities/3:

Profile images not loading properly on community posts

This appears to be a resource not found issue. Check for:
- Incorrect path or URL
- Missing file or resource
- Route configuration issues
- API endpoint availability

The issue seems to be with the URL construction for profile images. The 404 errors indicate that the image paths are incorrect. Check the avatar URL construction in the post component:

1. Review how profile image URLs are constructed
2. Check if there's a missing base path or domain
3. Verify if there's a fallback avatar implementation

Here's a potential solution:

```jsx
// Before:
<img src={post.author.avatarUrl} alt={`${post.author.username}'s avatar`} />

// After:
<img 
  src={post.author.avatarUrl || '/assets/default-avatar.png'} 
  alt={`${post.author.username}'s avatar`}
  onError={(e) => {
    e.target.onerror = null;
    e.target.src = '/assets/default-avatar.png';
  }}
/>
```

### Bug #3: Community search results pagination skips items

**Severity:** ðŸŸ¡ Low
**Location:** Community Search (/communities?search=pickle)
**Browser:** Chrome on Mobile

**Evidence:**
- SCREENSHOT: Pagination showing incorrect results
- CONSOLE: No errors, but behavior incorrect

**Solution Prompt:**

Fix the following issue in the Community Search area at path /communities?search=pickle:

Community search results pagination skips items

This appears to be a data loading or API issue. Check for:
- API endpoint correctness
- Data fetching logic
- Error handling for data loading
- State management during loading

The pagination logic appears to have an off-by-one error when calculating the offset for the next page. Review the pagination logic:

```jsx
// Before (assuming the issue is in the offset calculation):
const fetchNextPage = () => {
  const nextPage = currentPage + 1;
  const offset = nextPage * limit;
  fetchCommunities({ ...searchParams, offset });
};

// After (corrected):
const fetchNextPage = () => {
  const nextPage = currentPage + 1;
  const offset = nextPage * limit;
  // The key is to ensure we're not skipping items by using the correct offset
  fetchCommunities({ ...searchParams, offset, limit });
};
```

Also ensure that the API endpoint is correctly handling the offset and limit parameters:

```javascript
// Server-side pagination
const { offset = 0, limit = 10 } = req.query;
const communities = await db
  .select()
  .from(communitiesTable)
  .limit(parseInt(limit))
  .offset(parseInt(offset));
```

After fixing, verify the solution by:
1. Running focused Bounce tests on this specific area
2. Testing across multiple browsers (Chrome specifically)
3. Verifying no regression in related functionality

## Next Steps

1. Review each bug and its solution prompt
2. Implement fixes starting with critical issues first
3. Re-run Bounce tests to verify fixes
4. Update documentation as needed
