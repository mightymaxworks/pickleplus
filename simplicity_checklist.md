# Framework 5.3: Simplicity Checklist

Use this checklist when implementing a feature or fixing a bug to ensure you're following the simplicity principles of Framework 5.3.

## Initial Assessment

- [ ] Have I clearly identified the core issue or feature requirement?
- [ ] Have I stripped away non-essential requirements?
- [ ] Have I considered what the simplest possible solution might be?

## Solution Planning

- [ ] Am I using standard browser APIs when available? 
- [ ] Is my solution using the minimum number of dependencies?
- [ ] Am I creating a direct solution or adding unnecessary abstractions?

## Code Implementation

### State Management
- [ ] Am I using the minimum number of state variables needed?
- [ ] Could any of these state variables be combined or eliminated?
- [ ] Am I avoiding derived state when it's not necessary?

### Component Structure
- [ ] Is my component structure as flat as possible?
- [ ] Am I avoiding unnecessary wrapper divs or containers?
- [ ] Are my components focused on a single responsibility?

### Asynchronous Operations
- [ ] Am I using simple async/await patterns instead of complex chains?
- [ ] Am I handling loading states with a single boolean when possible?
- [ ] Are my error messages direct and actionable?

### Data Persistence
- [ ] Am I using localStorage directly when appropriate?
- [ ] Am I avoiding complex caching mechanisms for simple data?
- [ ] Is my data storage structure straightforward?

## Testing & Validation

- [ ] Have I tested the solution with the simplest possible test case?
- [ ] Does my solution work in all required scenarios without added complexity?
- [ ] Am I handling edge cases appropriately without overcomplicating?

## Complexity Warning Signs

Check if your solution has any of these warning signs that may indicate unnecessary complexity:

- [ ] More than 5 state variables for a component
- [ ] Deeply nested ternary operators or conditions
- [ ] Multiple levels of promise chains
- [ ] Custom utility functions that could be replaced with standard APIs
- [ ] More than 3 levels of component nesting for a single feature
- [ ] Storing redundant or calculable data in state
- [ ] Using complex state management for local component concerns
- [ ] Manual DOM manipulation when React could handle it
- [ ] Excessive comments explaining complex logic (may indicate overly complex code)

## Refactoring Opportunities

If you answered "yes" to any of the warning signs, consider these simplifications:

1. **Replace custom state management** with React's built-in hooks
2. **Replace URL.createObjectURL** with FileReader for image previews
3. **Replace complex caching systems** with direct localStorage usage
4. **Replace derived state** with calculations in the render method
5. **Replace nested ternaries** with early returns or separate components
6. **Replace complex validation logic** with library solutions (e.g., Zod, Yup)
7. **Replace custom throttle/debounce** with library or simple implementations
8. **Replace manual reference management** with React's useRef hook

## Example Comparison: Image Preview

### Complex Solution (Avoid)
```javascript
// Complex state
const [previewState, setPreviewState] = useState({ 
  url: null, 
  loading: false, 
  error: null, 
  metadata: null 
});

// Complex handling with multiple steps
const handleFileChange = (e) => {
  const file = e.target.files?.[0];
  if (!file) return;
  
  setPreviewState(prev => ({ ...prev, loading: true, error: null }));
  
  setTimeout(() => {
    try {
      const url = URL.createObjectURL(file);
      
      // Get extra metadata
      const img = new Image();
      img.onload = () => {
        setPreviewState({
          url,
          loading: false,
          error: null,
          metadata: {
            width: img.width,
            height: img.height,
            aspectRatio: img.width / img.height
          }
        });
      };
      img.onerror = () => {
        setPreviewState(prev => ({ ...prev, loading: false, error: 'Failed to load image' }));
      };
      img.src = url;
    } catch (error) {
      setPreviewState(prev => ({ ...prev, loading: false, error: error.message }));
    }
  }, 100);
};
```

### Simple Solution (Prefer)
```javascript
// Simple state
const [previewUrl, setPreviewUrl] = useState(null);
const [selectedFile, setSelectedFile] = useState(null);

// Direct approach with FileReader
const handleFileChange = (e) => {
  const file = e.target.files?.[0];
  if (!file) return;
  
  setSelectedFile(file);
  
  const reader = new FileReader();
  reader.onload = (event) => {
    setPreviewUrl(event.target.result);
  };
  reader.readAsDataURL(file);
};
```

## Final Validation Questions

- [ ] Could a junior developer understand this code easily?
- [ ] Does the solution use standard, well-known patterns?
- [ ] Is the solution easy to debug if something goes wrong?
- [ ] Will the solution be easy to modify or extend in the future?
- [ ] Does the solution avoid premature optimization?

Remember: The best code is often the code you don't have to write!
