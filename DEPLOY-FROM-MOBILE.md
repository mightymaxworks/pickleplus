# Pickle+ Mobile Deployment Guide

## Super-Simple Deployment Instructions

This guide uses a highly simplified approach designed specifically for deploying from mobile devices.

### Step 1: Prepare for Deployment

We've created a very simple landing page that will allow your deployment to successfully complete. While it won't have all the functionality of the full application, getting a successful deployment is the first step.

### Step 2: Deployment Settings

Copy and paste these exact commands into the Replit deployment form:

For the **Build Command**:
```
cp prod-package.json package.json && npm install
```

For the **Run Command**:
```
npm start
```

### Step 3: Deploy!

Click the Deploy button and wait for the deployment to complete. You should see a successful deployment with a simple landing page.

### After Deployment

Once this simple version is deployed, we can work on deploying the full application. This step is important because it verifies that your deployment process is working correctly.

## Troubleshooting

If deployment fails:
1. Check the logs in the deployment screen
2. Look for messages about failed installations or missing modules
3. Try the deployment again - sometimes it works on the second attempt
