# Unified Development Framework (UDF) Best Practices

## Overview
The UDF ensures consistent development patterns and prevents feature regression throughout the Pickle+ ecosystem. All components must follow these established patterns for maintainability and scalability.

## Core Framework Components

### 1. Enhanced MatchScoreCard Component
**Location**: `client/src/components/match/MatchScoreCard.tsx`

**Purpose**: Unified match display component with comprehensive scoring, algorithm protection, and player-friendly modes.

**Key Features**:
- **Algorithm Protection**: Player-friendly mode shows simplified progress ("+6 wins, +2 losses, doubled for tournaments") without exposing calculation details
- **Comprehensive Display**: Maintains all scoring information while providing clean user interface
- **Dual Point System Support**: Clear separation between Ranking Points (competitive standing) and Pickle Points (gamification currency)
- **Responsive Design**: Works across dashboard widgets, match recording, and admin interfaces

**Props Interface**:
```typescript
interface MatchScoreCardProps {
  match: MatchData;
  showPointsBreakdown?: boolean;  // Show detailed points calculation
  compact?: boolean;              // Compact mode for widgets
  className?: string;             // Custom styling
}
```

**Usage Patterns**:
- Dashboard Integration: `compact={true}`, `showPointsBreakdown={false}`
- Match Recording: Full display with all features enabled
- Admin Interface: Enhanced display with algorithm details when needed

### 2. Dashboard Integration Standards
**Component**: `RecentMatchesWidget.tsx`

**Enhancement Pattern**:
```typescript
// Replace basic components with UDF enhanced components
<MatchScoreCard 
  key={match.id} 
  match={match} 
  compact={true}
  showPointsBreakdown={false}
/>
```

**Benefits**:
- Consistent user experience across all interfaces
- Automatic algorithm protection
- Enhanced visual design with player-friendly feedback

## Development Guidelines

### 1. Component Enhancement (Not Replacement)
- **CRITICAL**: Always enhance existing components rather than creating new ones
- Maintain all existing functionality while adding new features
- Preserve comprehensive scoring displays - never remove built features for temporary fixes

### 2. Algorithm Protection Implementation
- Use player-friendly modes to show simplified progress
- Hide complex calculation details from end users
- Maintain algorithm integrity through controlled exposure

### 3. UDF Integration Process
1. Identify component for enhancement
2. Add UDF props interface if needed
3. Implement player-friendly modes
4. Update all references across codebase
5. Test in multiple contexts (dashboard, admin, mobile)

### 4. Points System Standardization
**Algorithm Reference**: PICKLE_PLUS_ALGORITHM_DOCUMENT.md (ONLY authoritative source)

**System B Standards**:
- 3 points win, 1 point loss (official algorithm)
- No doubles/streak bonuses
- Elite threshold at ≥1000 points
- Development players get 1.15x women cross-gender bonus

**Ranking Points Precision Standards**:
- **CRITICAL**: Use decimal precision (2 decimal places) for all ranking points calculations
- **NO ROUNDING UP**: Preserve exact calculated values (e.g., 1.15, 3.25, 2.75)
- **Storage**: Database must support decimal precision (PostgreSQL DECIMAL or NUMERIC)
- **Display**: Show exact values with 2 decimal places in UI components
- **Calculation**: All multipliers applied with full precision (gender 1.15x, age 1.2x, etc.)

**Age Multiplier Standards (Option B - Open Age Group)**:
- **CRITICAL**: Players always receive their age multiplier regardless of opponent age
- **Age Categories**: Open (1.0x), 35+ (1.2x), 50+ (1.3x), 60+ (1.5x), 70+ (1.6x)
- **Cross-Generational Play**: 35+ players competing with Open players get 1.2x bonus
- **Compound Multipliers**: Age and gender bonuses stack (e.g., 35+ female = 1.2 × 1.15 = 1.38x)
- **Algorithm Formula**: Final Points = Base × Age Multiplier × Gender Multiplier × Match Type
- **UDF Enforcement**: All match recording must apply age multipliers per PICKLE_PLUS_ALGORITHM_DOCUMENT

**Pickle Points Conversion**:
- **MANDATORY 1.5x multiplier**: Applied **PER MATCH** when ranking points are earned
- **Critical Implementation**: Pickle Points = CEIL(Match Ranking Points Earned × 1.5) 
- **Pickle Points ONLY**: Use CEIL function for rounding up conversions
- **NOT a blanket conversion**: Do NOT multiply total ranking points by 1.5x
- **Correct Flow**: Each match awards both ranking points AND Pickle Points simultaneously
- **System-wide enforcement**: All match recording must calculate both point types per match
- **UDF Enforcement**: `awardMatchPoints(rankingPoints)` must award both ranking and Pickle Points
- **Forbidden**: Converting existing total ranking points to Pickle Points retroactively

## Quality Assurance

### 1. Component Validation
- All enhanced components must maintain backward compatibility
- Player-friendly modes must not expose algorithm details
- Comprehensive displays must remain intact

### 2. Integration Testing
- Test enhanced components in all usage contexts
- Verify algorithm protection is working correctly
- Ensure responsive design across devices

### 3. Performance Standards
- Enhanced components must not impact load times
- Compact modes must be optimized for dashboard widgets
- All components must support real-time updates

## Enforcement Mechanisms

### 1. Code Review Requirements
- All new components must follow UDF patterns
- Enhancement over replacement must be demonstrated
- Algorithm protection must be verified

### 2. Documentation Updates
- Update this document when adding new UDF components
- Maintain clear usage examples for all enhanced components
- Document any breaking changes or migration paths

### 3. Testing Standards
- Unit tests for all enhanced components
- Integration tests for dashboard widgets
- End-to-end tests for critical user journeys

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Planned UDF Components
- Enhanced Tournament Management widgets
- Unified Coach Application interfaces
- Standardized Admin Panel components

### 2. Framework Extensions
- Mobile-first responsive patterns
- Accessibility compliance standards
- Internationalization integration
