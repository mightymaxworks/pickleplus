# Development Framework v5.2 [DEPRECATED]

> **IMPORTANT: This framework version has been deprecated. Please refer to Framework v5.1 for current development guidelines.**

This document is maintained for historical reference only. All development should follow the Framework v5.1 guidelines.

## Original Overview (Historical Reference Only)

The Pickle+ Development Framework v5.2 was an experimental extension of v5.1 architecture that focused on open-source integration and modular development. This approach has been discontinued in favor of maintaining the custom development focus of Framework v5.1.

## Migration Guide

To revert from Framework v5.2 to v5.1:

1. Follow the standard Framework v5.1 development patterns
2. Continue with custom implementation of community features
3. Ignore open-source evaluation requirements
4. Maintain the existing layered architecture approach

See `development_framework_v5.1.md` for the complete current development guidelines.
